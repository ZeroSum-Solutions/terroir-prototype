# Visual Wine Platform — Spec List & Migration Manifest

Date: 2026-08-24 · Status: **ACTIVE — §1's migration manifest is normative and CI-enforced**
by `scripts/check-migration-manifest.mjs` (and `src/test/contracts/check-migration-manifest.test.ts`).
A new migration must be added to §1 or the merge gate fails. §2–§4 remain planning material. · Parent:
`2026-08-24-visual-wine-platform-prd.md` (VWP-FR IDs cited below) · Architecture:
`2026-08-24-visual-wine-platform-synthesis.md` (v4, audit converged).

Tickets are NOT cut from this list until: (a) the owner approves the PRD, (b) the gating
spikes for each spec have run (§Spike register), and (c) the owner confirms Gate 0
threshold values (VWP-D-01). Evals follow the repo protocol
(`docs/evals/top10-evals.yaml`): each eval becomes ≥1 failing test first; a slice lands
only when its evals AND the global gates are green.

## 1. Migration manifest (normative — satisfies VWP-FR-005)

Migration numbers define deterministic replay order, not commit landing chronology. Numbers
`0112`–`0126` remain preallocated to the Visual Wine Platform sequence; approved,
order-independent migrations may use the reserved band and land earlier. The CI
uniqueness/manifest check governs every migration numbered `0112` or higher. No migration in
that governed range may be created except from this manifest; changes to the manifest land in
THIS document first.

| # | File | Contents | Depends on | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0112 | `wine_editions.sql` | `wine_editions` (vintage-grain, `0`=NV, `UNIQUE (canonical_wine_id, vintage)`, vintage CHECK, `lwin11` partial unique `WHERE lwin11 IS NOT NULL`), P2 §8 write posture, `wine_variants.edition_id` + client-write guard, server-side linking fn (provenance-recording) + LWIN11 corroboration gate (canonical + vintage agreement), backfill + quarantine queue | P2 (0097–0101); spike 11 verdict | SPEC-01 |
| 0113 | `image_licenses.sql` | P4 as designed (was P4-0112) | — | SPEC-02 |
| 0114 | `image_sources.sql` | P4 (was 0113) | 0113 | SPEC-02 |
| 0115 | `wine_images.sql` | P4 core table — keyed `canonical_wine_id` + `(vintage, size_ml)` tuple, NO edition FK (was 0114) | 0113–0114 | SPEC-02 |

| 0120 | `resolve_wine_images_bulk.sql` | P4 (was 0119) | 0115 | SPEC-02 |
| 0121 | `containers_slots.sql` | `containers` (types: rack_grid, fridge_shelves, case, wall, zone) + `slots`, `restaurant_id` + RLS across both, composite same-tenant FKs | — | SPEC-09 |
| 0122 | `bottle_placements.sql` | `bottle_placements` (slot_id, inventory_item_id, active/removed lifecycle), `UNIQUE (slot_id)` over active rows, transactional `count(active) ≤ inventory_items.quantity` guard, place-from-lot operation (one row per bottle) | 0121 | SPEC-09 |
| 0123 | `bins_to_containers.sql` | ONE-TIME move: each live bin → a `zone` container (code/zone/capacity carried; `zone` containers auto-generate unordered slots, capacity-bounded when set); each lot's binned quantity → N placements; `inventory_items.bin_id`/`bin_location` become read-legacy (writes revoked); `wine_lists.show_bin_codes` surface repointed at container codes | 0121–0122; bins e2e suite migrated in the same PR | SPEC-10 |
| 0124 | `ratings_stores.sql` | `user_wine_reviews`, `external_rating_events` (one grain per event), `rating_aggregates` (two grains, lineage, no fan-out) | 0112 | SPEC-15 |
| 0125 | `ratings_read_model.sql` | Read model (edition-first, labeled canonical fallback, tenant-local rollups) | 0124 | SPEC-15 |
| 0126 | `legacy_ratings_migration.sql` | 0025 `wines.rating`/`rating_source`/`review_excerpt` → `external_rating_events`; readers repointed in the same PR | 0124–0125 | SPEC-24 |
| 0127 | `match_lwin_deterministic_tiebreak.sql` | `create or replace public.match_lwin(text, text, float)`: retain 0078 matching semantics and add `ORDER BY score DESC, lc.lwin_id ASC`; `match_lwin_batch` and `match_lwin_bulk` inherit the total ordering through their existing calls | 0078 | — |
| 0128 | `apply_import_batch_chunk_sibling_lock.sql` | `create or replace public.apply_import_batch_chunk(uuid, integer)`: transaction-scoped advisory lock plus under-lock sibling-applied recheck; raise `P0004` on conflict | 0108 | — |
| 0129 | `import_batches_digest_boundary.sql` | `not valid` CHECK requiring new `content_sha256` values to match a shape 0128 can normalise, plus a `before update` trigger freezing the column (`P0005`); closes the manufactured-malformed-digest bypass of 0128's barrier | 0128 | — |
| 0130 | `wine_image_storage.sql` | Creates the `wine-images` storage bucket (public, 10 MB, JPEG/PNG/WebP) plus restaurant-scoped insert/update/delete policies. Declares the bucket `src/domains/cellar/wine-image-service.ts` has written to since BND-057 but that no migration ever created — a fresh environment had a hero-image upload that could only fail. Distinct from 0116, which provisions storage for P4's `wine_images` table; this one serves the shipped `wines.hero_image_url` feature and does not wait on P4. | 0072 | — |
| 0131 | `xwines_catalog.sql` | `xwines_catalog` (100,646 rows of the CC0-1.0 X-Wines Full corpus: type, elaborate, grapes, food pairings, ABV, body, acidity, country/region, winery + website, the vintage list, and the per-wine rating average/count aggregated from the corpus's 21,013,536 ratings) plus `xwines_vintage_ratings` (per `(wine_id, vintage)` average/count, 1,008,593 rows) — the grain "Compare Vintages" needs. Global reference tables in the shape of `lwin_catalog`: authenticated-select-only RLS, trigram indexes on winery and wine name. Carries the attributes the cellar has no column for anywhere today — body, acidity, ABV, food pairing, community rating. | 0003 | — |
| 0132 | `canonical_wines_xwines_link.sql` | `canonical_wines.xwines_wine_id` (FK → `xwines_catalog`, `on delete set null`) + `xwines_match_score real`, and `match_xwines(text, text, float)` — a producer-weighted trigram matcher mirroring 0127's `match_lwin`, including its deterministic `order by score desc, wine_id asc` tie-break. Attaches the corpus at the SHARED catalog grain (`canonical_wines`), not per-tenant `wines`, because body/acidity/ABV/pairing are producer+cuvée facts and must not be duplicated per restaurant. | 0097; 0131 | — |
| 0133 | `xwines_catalog_lower_trgm_indexes.sql` | GIN trigram indexes on `lower(winery_name)` and `lower(name)` for `xwines_catalog`. 0131 indexed the RAW columns, but `match_xwines` (0132) prefilters on `lower(xc.winery_name) % lower(p_producer)`, and Postgres cannot serve a functional expression from a bare-column index — every call parallel-seq-scanned all 100,646 rows. Same defect and same remedy as 0078 for `lwin_catalog.lower(producer)`. Index-only addition: no function, grant or matching semantics changes. | 0131; 0132 | — |
| 0134 | `match_xwines_top_n.sql` | `create or replace public.match_xwines(text, text, float, integer)`: adds `p_limit integer default 5` and returns the top N by the existing `score desc, wine_id asc` order instead of `limit 1`. The caller's acceptance floors (`xwines-profile.ts`) are stricter than the RPC's prefilter, so a `limit 1` that the client then rejects discarded valid runner-up candidates unseen. Matching predicates, weighting, `security definer`, `search_path` and grants are unchanged; the single-argument-arity function is dropped so the overload does not shadow. | 0132; 0133 | — |
| 0135 | `identity_resolution_on_write.sql` | `create or replace public.find_or_create_wines_batch(uuid, jsonb)`: one bulk `resolve_wine_variants_bulk` call after the existing loop, writing `wines.wine_variant_id` (`canonical_wine_id` follows from 0098's trigger), plus a re-runnable backfill for every `wines` row still unresolved. Closes the gap where 0099's resolver had zero production callers, so every wine created after 0101's one-shot backfill carried a null identity forever and `xwines-profile.ts`'s `canonical_wine_id` link (0132) never fired. Deliberately does NOT touch `apply_import_batch_chunk` or the import dedup key — §9/§12 of the P2 plan place that call in P3's TypeScript caller, before the per-row loop. | 0097–0101; 0079 | — |
| 0136 | `wine_ownership_on_write_policies.sql` | `alter policy` on both write policies for `stock_adjustments` and `bottle_closeouts`, adding an `exists` check that the row's `wine_id` (and `bottle_closeouts.open_bottle_id`, when non-null) belongs to the row's own `restaurant_id`. Closes the [HIGH] cross-tenant cascade-delete hole: both columns are `on delete cascade`, Postgres cascades bypass RLS, and the prior policies gated only on membership of the row's own restaurant — so a tenant could file a policy-compliant row naming another tenant's wine, and that tenant's later delete of their own wine silently destroyed it. Proven live before the fix (tenant B's row count went 2 → 1 on tenant A's delete) and re-proven closed after. Amends rather than recreates, per 0084's precedent, so the `roles={public}` list is untouched. | 0060; 0063; 0084 | — |
| 0137 | `backfill_blank_producers_from_lwin.sql` | Recovers `wines.producer` for wines imported with an empty producer, by longest-word-prefix match of `name` against the 211,498-row `lwin_catalog` producer set. A CSV import created 1277 such wines (`producer=''`, producer run together with the cuvee in `name`); their source rows carry `"producer": ""`, so nothing is recoverable from the import itself. Identity resolution is producer-first, so these could neither resolve to the spine nor match LWIN — 108/1385 wines resolved before this. Prefix beats trigram on precision (trigram scored `Agrapart Experience` against `ABK6, L'Experience, Cognac` and would have written ABK6); a stoplist excludes the generic catalog entries `Chateau`/`Maison`/`Clos`/`Tenuta` that otherwise swallow `Château Sainte Anne`. Measured on production before writing: **956 of 1277 repaired, 956 newly resolved, total 108 → 1064 of 1385.** Every write recorded in `producer_backfill_audit` so the down is an exact reversal. | 0099; 0105; 0135 | — |
| 0138 | `xwines_catalog_imagery.sql` | Four nullable columns on `xwines_catalog` — `image_url`, `image_kind`, `image_source`, `image_credit` — plus a closed-vocabulary CHECK on `image_kind` (`label`/`producer`/`representative`), an all-or-nothing CHECK binding url+kind+source, and a partial index on `image_kind` where `image_url is not null`. 1,007 of the corpus's 100,646 wines had a photograph (1.0%); there is no open collection of 100,646 wine labels, so the column set records WHICH of three strengths of claim each picture is rather than flattening them into one `label_image_url` that would be false for most rows. `image_source`/`image_credit` carry per-source licensing (X-Wines CC0-1.0; Open Food Facts contributor photos CC-BY-SA-3.0; Wikimedia Commons per-file) for NFR-5 containment — they record what the source stated and are not a clearance. Populated by `scripts/local/harvest-wine-imagery.mjs` + `scripts/local/seed-catalog-imagery.mjs`. | 0130; 0131; 0133 | — |
| 0141 | `canonical_wines_xwines_grant.sql` | `grant select (xwines_wine_id, xwines_match_score) on public.canonical_wines to authenticated`. 0097 made this table's SELECT grant COLUMN-level on purpose, enumerating twelve columns so the two `created_by_*` audit columns stay unreadable across tenants — and a column-level grant is a closed list, so every column added later defaults to unreadable. 0132 added `xwines_wine_id`/`xwines_match_score`, granted execute on `match_xwines()`, and stopped. The result was not a degraded feature but a dead code path: `resolveXWinesProfile` opens by reading the trusted link (`xwines-profile.ts:307`), which returned 42501 for every authenticated caller, and its error branch correctly returns `unavailable` rather than falling through to the matcher — so the wine detail page showed no taste profile, no pairings, no community rating and no vintage comparison for every wine with a canonical row, in every environment, since 0132. Service-role seeding never saw it because it bypasses grants. Read-only and no wider than 0132 already intended (`match_xwines` has been authenticated-executable since then and returns `wine_id` for the whole corpus); both `created_by_*` columns remain unreadable. `0097_identity_spine_grants.sql` asserted this grant only through `producer_norm` and so passed straight over the gap; it now asserts the columns the application actually selects. | 0097; 0132 | — |
| 0139, 0140 | unused | Reserved during the imagery/operational-seed work and never taken; left as a gap rather than renumbered, since 0141 was already applied and recorded in `schema_migrations`. | — | — |
| 0142 | `anon_wine_hero_image_grant.sql` | `grant select (hero_image_url) on public.wines to anon`. 0081 replaced anon's table-level SELECT on `wines` with a column-level grant, and a column-level grant is a CLOSED list — every column added afterwards defaults to unreadable for anon. `hero_image_url` was never in it, so the published guest menu (`/list/[slug]`), whose entire purpose is showing wines to guests, could render each wine's name, producer, vintage and serving temperature but not its photograph. One column, deliberately: 0081's model (no table-level grant, an explicit column list instead) is untouched, and this column is a URL into the already world-readable `wine-images` bucket carrying no pricing, cost, supplier or operational signal. `0074_public_api_grants.sql` pins the anon column list in BOTH directions, so both halves of that assertion are updated in the same change rather than loosened. | 0081 | — |
| 0143 | `invoice_scan_deletion.sql` | SCAN-04 / decision D6: `invoice_scans.status_reason` (the stated reason a zero-item or failed scan is in the ledger — the ledger already keeps those rows, it just could not say why), the table's first-ever DELETE policy (manager-scoped via `member_restaurant_ids_with_role`; SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE were all it had, which is also why the two error-path rollback DELETEs in `POST /api/inventory/save-scan` were silent no-ops), the `invoice_scan_deletions` append-only audit table, and `delete_invoice_scan(uuid)` — one transaction that reverses exactly the `inventory_items` rows the scan created (`invoice_scan_id = p_scan_id`) BEFORE deleting the scan, because that FK is `ON DELETE SET NULL` and the reverse order orphans the stock. Not `revert_import_batch` (0109): that function walks `import_batch_rows.applied_inventory_item_id` and an invoice scan has no batch, no rows table and no applied-id column — there is no argument shape that makes it accept a scan id. Mirrors its rules (only this scan's rows, never `wines`, `auth.uid()` never client-supplied) rather than inventing new ones. | 0002; 0066; 0084; 0090 | — |
| 0144 | `wines_fuzzy_search.sql` | SCAN-06 / decision D3 (fuzzy half only; the corpus-coverage half stays blocked on a commercial data licence): `immutable_unaccent(text)`, a `gin (immutable_unaccent(lower(producer || ' ' || name)) gin_trgm_ops)` index on `public.wines` — the table had no trigram index at all — and `search_wines_fuzzy(uuid, text, float, integer)`, which scores a row as the MAX per-token `word_similarity` over the accent-folded `producer || ' ' || name`. The reported failure was a search for "Fredric savart" returning nothing: the route built ONE ILIKE pattern out of the WHOLE query, so it could neither span producer + name nor tolerate a typo or a dropped accent. Whole-string `similarity()` is not the fix either (0 rows at the 0.3 default — a long wine name dilutes a short query). The 0.5 threshold is load-bearing and is therefore explicit: 'fredric' -> 'Frédéric' scores 0.545455, which clears 0.5 and FAILS pg_trgm's 0.6 default, so inheriting the default would ship the bug. Matches `producer || ' ' || name` rather than `producer` because 1,277 of 1,527 local wines carry an empty producer with the name embedded (0137's unrepaired remainder). SECURITY INVOKER, not the SECURITY DEFINER of `match_lwin`/`match_xwines`: those read global catalogues, this reads tenant data, so 0079's rule applies and `wines` RLS is the enforcing layer with the explicit `restaurant_id = p_restaurant_id` predicate behind it. | 0079; 0127; 0133; 0137 | — |
| 0145 | `lwin_xwines_links.sql` | WS-IDENT P0 (`2026-08-31-ws-ident-identity-policy.md` §5): `xwines_link_runs` (run provenance: rule version, params), `lwin_xwines_links` (one current decision per `lwin_catalog` row — accepted links carry corpus id + score vector, review rows a closed-vocabulary reason, abstentions stored as first-class rows; shape-enforcing CHECKs), `lwin_xwines_link_tombstones` (pairs a human split; never auto-accepted again). Links are authenticated-select-only global reference data (P1 dedupe reads them); runs and tombstones follow 0137's two-layer deny (revoke + RLS-no-policy, service_role only). Written only by `scripts/link-lwin-xwines.ts`. | 0003; 0131; 0137 (pattern) | — |
| 0146 | `xwines_search.sql` | P1 slice 1 (unified palette, `2026-08-31-unified-search-companion-and-canonical-facts.md` §7): `xwines_search(text, int)` — free-text trigram search over `xwines_catalog` in `lwin_search`'s shape (one query string vs winery + wine name, best similarity wins), on the 0133 lower-expression indexes, with 0127's deterministic `wine_id asc` tie-break. Explicit column list (identity, geography, image url+kind, score). Granted to authenticated and service_role. | 0007 (shape); 0131; 0133 | — |
| 0147 | `xwines_catalog_name_lower_trgm_index.sql` | `gin (lower(name) gin_trgm_ops)` on `xwines_catalog` — the second half of the pair 0146's header assumed 0133 had built. 0133 indexed only `lower(winery_name)`, so `xwines_search`'s `lower(name)` predicate seq-scanned all 100,646 rows on every palette keystroke: measured 2026-09-01 at 1,459 ms on production and 681 ms locally for `esporao reserva`, 245 ms locally with the index (94 ms for `pol roger`). Index-only, 0133's exact shape; same rows, faster. The raw-column `xwines_catalog_name_trgm_idx` (0131) stays for `match_xwines`. | 0131; 0133; 0146 | — |
| 0148 | `wine_notes.sql` | Phase 1 of `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-03-wine-page-design.md`: `wine_notes` (the house tasting-note corpus — body, optional 100-point score, tasted_on, self-attributed author), `descriptors` (global controlled vocabulary; `family` groups chips and carries NO colour, because DESIGN.md forbids a fifth hue and bans exactly the warm mid-tones an aroma palette needs), `wine_note_descriptors` (composite PK is load-bearing — promotion of a model suggestion from `inferred` to `confirmed` is an UPDATE, and without the key an insert-based promotion would double-count that descriptor in every tally), `wine_reference_notes` (GLOBAL like `lwin_catalog`/`xwines_catalog`, no `restaurant_id`, deliberately NO tenant INSERT policy — service-role written only, since an authenticated user must never author a row every other tenant reads as sourced fact; `vintage` is NOT NULL because a vintage-less row would attach one vintage's score to another with a source URL beside it), and `wines.drink_window_basis` + `drink_window_set_by`/`set_at`. `wine_notes` RLS follows 0136 rather than membership alone: `wine_id` is `on delete cascade` and cascades bypass RLS, so the INSERT policy carries an `exists` check that the row's wine belongs to the row's own restaurant. `drink_window_basis` exists for two reasons — `manual_overrides text[]` cannot say WHO set a window, so the house's own window would otherwise be the only one unable to name its author; and `batch.ts` selects wines on `drink_window_start is null`, so without it the phase-2 retirement would make every retired wine the primary target of the next enrichment run and regenerate exactly what it removed. Additive only: four new tables and three new columns, and the one backfill writes only the new column. Override is written before inference so a wine satisfying both conditions resolves to `override`. | 0060; 0084; 0097; 0136 | — |
| 0149 | `seed_descriptors.sql` | Seeds the 22-term starting tasting vocabulary into `descriptors` (0148) across seven families — fruit, floral, herbal, oak, earth, spice, fault. `on conflict (slug) do nothing`, so it is idempotent across the `supabase db reset` it is re-run by on every local bring-up, and so the owner's pass lands as a second insert rather than a rewrite of this one. Slugs are stable identifiers and must not be renamed once `wine_note_descriptors` rows reference them. THE WORD LIST IS A STARTING POINT, not a finished one: §8 of the design spec records it as an open item, because a vocabulary that does not match how the house actually talks about wine gets ignored, and an ignored vocabulary produces the empty aggregate the feature cannot survive. Families group and label chips and carry NO colour — DESIGN.md forbids a fifth hue and the palette gate bans exactly the warm mid-tones an aroma palette needs (D10). The down deletes by slug rather than truncating, so a later extension survives, and it is blocked by the FK if any note already references a seeded slug — user-authored content is not silently cascaded away to revert a seed. | 0148 | — |
| 0150 | `seed_notes_from_tasting_notes.sql` | Moves the legacy free-text `wines.tasting_notes` into the house corpus and makes `wine_notes.author_user_id` nullable. That field carried no author — it is one text column per wine, written by whoever was editing it — so seeding under the owner's id would put words in a named person's mouth, the exact dishonesty D7 exists to remove. A legacy note genuinely has no author and the column is made to say so. This does NOT weaken attribution: 0148's INSERT policy still requires `author_user_id = auth.uid()`, which a null fails, so only the service role running this migration can write one. The UI keeps the two absences apart — an unattributed legacy note reads "From the cellar record", a colleague whose name will not resolve reads "Someone here". `wines.tasting_notes` is deliberately NOT dropped: old code reads it during the deploy window and the cellar drawer reads it today. The edit-metadata modal stops offering the field, so the composer becomes the one capture path. The `not exists` guard makes it re-runnable, which matters because it replays on every local `supabase db reset` — without it a second run would double every seeded note and every mention count later built on them. Measured on the local seed: 41 legacy notes in, 41 after a second run. | 0148 | — |
| 0151 | `inventory_commands.sql` | TER-CF-150 / TER-CF-270..273: durable `(restaurant_id, operation_id)` receipts plus one authenticated `execute_inventory_command` RPC for atomic open, pour, spill, lifecycle discard, and measured close. Replays revalidate current membership and require the same actor and canonical payload; `expected_opened_at` is canonicalized in UTC independently of the session timezone; every command serializes on the tenant-owned wine and uses monotonic event/lifecycle timestamps. Close and discard both require the reusable slot id plus exact `opened_at`; discard drains the locked remainder as one spill without a closeout or replacement. Preservation, sealed-stock decrement, events, and closeout commit or roll back together. `undo_last_pour` keeps single-lifecycle/single-chunk compatibility but atomically refuses a multi-chunk command or prior-lifecycle event; the down refuses while any receipt exists. Existing `record_pour` and `close_open_bottle` signatures remain unchanged for expand-contract deployment compatibility. | 0016; 0044; 0060–0061; 0087–0088; 0136 | TER-CF-150; TER-CF-270..273 |
| 0152 | `workspace_access_foundation.sql` | TER-CF-274..281: additive shadow workspace/site-access foundation. Each legacy restaurant is linked to an identity-preserving restaurant workspace; legacy memberships remain the only explicit site grant and authoritative access path. Workspace membership, lifecycle state, and fixed role capabilities are observable through authenticated shadow helpers without granting new assignment or enforcement authority. Exact cross-user/workspace composite constraints, personal-workspace exclusion, derived-row cleanup, and conservative guarded down behavior preserve legacy IDs, roles, access, signup, invitation, and delete semantics. Forward and down use fail-fast maintenance-window locks; the same direct-owner executor must pass the no-DDL privilege/lock preflight before apply. | 0001; 0053; 0151 | TER-CF-274..281 |
| 0153 | `physical_bottle_expansion.sql` | TER-CF-298..315 Phase A: additive physical-bottle columns/containment, a closed effect resolver, dormant exact-bottle writers behind contract version 1, invoker exact/aggregate/effective-event readers, explicit ACL/RLS closure, and a guarded down. Legacy one-slot-per-wine uniqueness, writers, triggers, imports, scans, merges, and version-1 receipts remain active; this foundation is not C06 completion. | 0016; 0038; 0044; 0050; 0060–0061; 0074; 0087–0088; 0100; 0109–0110; 0136; 0143; 0151–0152 | TER-CF-298..315 (Phase A foundation only; no completion claim) |
| 0154 | `site_capability_authority.sql` | C04 additive authority A: sealed exact-site capability grant history, database-owned site/workspace lifecycle generations, ordered retirement, governance-only exact-set replacement, identity-bound evaluators, and a cost-and-margin gated pricing reader. The three-key vocabulary is closed; legacy pricing SELECT and all 0152 guards remain active. No application cutover, contract B, role expansion, or C04 completion claim. | 0065; 0074; 0080; 0084; 0152 | TER-CF-321..324 (additive authority A only; no completion claim) |
| 0148+ | reserved | Durable import staging IF VWP-D-04 chooses it; `wine_edition_formats` when barcode authority needs it; splat asset metadata if the spike passes | per decision | — |

**Sequencing note (documented deviation from PRD phase lettering):** rows 0112–0126
preserve the VWP DDL replay sequence. The order-independent function replacements at
0127–0129 are allocated from the reserved band and may land before that sequence; on a
clean rebuild they replay after it. Within the VWP sequence, substrate DDL (0121–0123)
precedes ratings DDL (0124–0126) to honor the synthesis's audited
"containers/slots/placements = 0121+" assignment. PRD Phases C and D describe feature
delivery and may overlap; ratings feature work starts as soon as 0124–0125 land. Nothing
in ratings blocks on the bins move (0123).

Every migration: paired down, snapshot update, generated types, RLS tests, drift check,
plus the regression suite for whatever landed surface it touches (NFR-4 / risk R7).

## 2. Spec slices

Format: scope → key contracts → gated by → acceptance evidence. Full per-spec documents
are written only for slices whose contracts aren't already normative in the synthesis/P4
doc (marked ★); the rest cite their source and go straight to tickets once gates clear.

### Identity & corpus

- **SPEC-01 ★ Editions + backfill (0112)** — VWP-FR-001..004. DDL per manifest; server
  linking fn; backfill classifier (dated / explicit-NV / quarantine) + report; Gate-0
  blocker: pilot 100% resolved-or-quarantined. Gated by: spike 11 (`wine_lineages`
  disposition — note repo eval F-2 says `wines.lineage_id` exists with LWIN7 grouping, so
  "deprecated" is not assumable). Acceptance: PRD criteria 2–3.
- **SPEC-02 P4 land + renumber (0113–0120)** — VWP-FR-009. Spec = the P4 doc itself
  (`2026-08-23-p4-image-enrichment.md`) with its header amendment; files renamed in the
  0112 commit; P4's inline numbering updated when its tickets are cut. Unwarp amendment
  folded in (SPEC-03). Acceptance: P4's own migration/test plan + PRD criterion 1.
- **SPEC-03 ★ Unwarp shared library** — VWP-FR-009. Cylinder unwarp as a lib consumed by
  the Gate-0 scan service (queries AND reference derivatives) and by P4's pipeline at
  scale; raw crop always retained; no-unwarp fallback texture guaranteed. Gated by:
  spike 7 (phone-vs-packshot LightGlue survival informs how much unwarp matters).
- **SPEC-04 ★ Pilot enrichment run (Gate 0 corpus)** — VWP-FR-007, D2. 500-variant
  stratified pilot: dedupe → editions → enrichment cascade (local joins → barcode → DDGS →
  Brave) → verified reference images → frozen index build for exactly those editions.
  Gated by: SPEC-01/02 landed; spikes 3–5 (WS/GWS coverage, X-Wines joins, DDGS soak).
  Acceptance: reference-image coverage + precision reported per VWP-FR-016.
- **SPEC-07 Import scale-up (20k CSV)** — VWP-FR-008. Durable staging vs. `MAX_ROWS`
  raise decided by VWP-D-04 (staging → takes an 0130+ number). Acceptance: full partner
  CSV ingested with P3 chunked-apply semantics intact; import e2e green.

### Identification

- **SPEC-05 ★ Scan service** — VWP-FR-012..015, D4. Parallel arms (ZXing / PaddleOCR→
  trigram+BM25 / DINOv2→exact FAISS) → union → LightGlue rerank (reference-image
  admission; OCR-only candidates survive) → calibrated fusion → top-3 or ABSTAIN; barcode
  contract incl. the candidate-constraint path; edition-only result type; response embeds
  ranked editions + tenant placement sets (0/1/N). Topology per VWP-FR-018. Gated by:
  spikes 6 (latency topology), 7 (LightGlue), 10 (GTIN coverage/vintage-uniqueness →
  VWP-D-07). Acceptance: PRD criteria 5–6 + Gate 0.
- **SPEC-06 ★ Gate 0 eval harness + benchmark** — VWP-FR-016..017. Frozen working set +
  sealed holdout (identity-disjoint from tuning/calibration; out-of-corpus + non-wine +
  near-duplicate-vintage cases); query-level metrics with abstention-as-miss; report
  format; Gate 0-R re-run (SPEC-08) on the final index. Gated by: VWP-D-01 (owner
  thresholds). Acceptance: PRD criterion 4; published numbers = the "frozen scan proof".
  *Spike-4 correction (2026-08-25): WineSensed cannot supply the labeled accuracy
  denominator — its rows carry opaque Vivino IDs with no wine/winery names, so its photos
  cannot be mapped to our editions. It is hard-negative / out-of-corpus abstention material
  and a domain-gap reference only. The labeled top-1/top-3 denominator comes from
  partner-cellar photos labeled by resolved edition (as Gate 0 already specifies). Drop
  "benchmark" framing for WineSensed wherever it appears.*
- **SPEC-08 Gate 0-R** — re-execution of SPEC-06 on the full partner index before any
  investor rehearsal; same metric family/thresholds; room bottles in the eval set.

### 3D substrate

- **SPEC-09 ★ Containers/slots/placements DDL (0121–0122)** — VWP-FR-028..029. All
  integrity + tenancy invariants IN the migration + regression suite. Acceptance: PRD
  criterion 7 (first half).
- **SPEC-10 ★ Bins one-time move (0123)** — VWP-FR-030. FK move off
  `inventory_items.bin_id` onto placements; ~40 production rows carried; bins e2e suite
  migrated; `show_bin_codes` surface preserved. Acceptance: PRD criterion 7 (second half).
- **SPEC-11 ★ Bottle-detail API** — VWP-FR-031. Keyed to `bottle_placement_id`; response
  contract per PRD; variant-level fallback card for unplaced stock; tenant isolation.
  This is the Codex renderer's consumption contract — freeze it early (SPEC-13).
  Acceptance: PRD criterion 8.
- **SPEC-12 Assisted space setup UI** — VWP-FR-032. Bounded v1 contract (grid racks +
  shelf fridges, corner calibration, per-slot edit, non-photo fallback). Gated by:
  spike 8 (UX flow). No count/identity authority from photos.
- **SPEC-13 Renderer contract + texture exports** — VWP-FR-033. Template GLB library,
  texture export endpoints from P4 derivatives (scope resolver per VWP-FR-010), UV
  hints/aspect/shape-class in bottle-detail; written FOR Codex's parallel renderer work.
- **SPEC-14 Splat overlay** — desktop-only, ships only on spike 2 pass (VWP-D-06);
  Polycam→GaussianSplats3D; asset metadata migration only if approved (0130+).

### Ratings

- **SPEC-15 ★ Ratings stores + read model (0124–0125)** — VWP-FR-019..020. DDL + read
  model; grain discipline; labeled canonical fallback. Acceptance: PRD criterion 9.
- **SPEC-16 External ratings ingestion** — X-Wines offline pre-aggregation (21M rows
  never live), Wine-Searcher/GWS fetchers, demo-cellar prefetch cache. Gated by: spike 3
  (WS trial + GWS coverage + written quotes).
- **SPEC-17 WS median fix** — VWP-FR-022. True median or "avg-based" label at
  `src/lib/wine-intelligence/wine-searcher.ts:196–201` before ANY display ships.
- **SPEC-18 Ratings display UI** — VWP-FR-020/022. "Aggregated critic score" labeling;
  no "Vinous" string; community stars; tenant stars/notes separate.
- **SPEC-24 Legacy reconciliation (0126)** — VWP-FR-021 + VWP-FR-006. 0025 data
  migration + reader repoint; `wine_lineages` disposition executed per spike 11 verdict.

### Voice

- **SPEC-19 Voice intake** — VWP-FR-023. Push-to-talk → batch STT → slot-filling →
  `resolve_wine_variants_bulk` → confirmation UI; tenant keyterm vocabulary. Gated by:
  spike 1 (STT eval → VWP-D-02).
- **SPEC-20 ★ Voice retrieval tool** — VWP-FR-024..025. ONE constrained tool; in-tool
  server-side name→ID resolution; disambiguation lists; explicit not-found; hard-gated on
  populated placements. Acceptance: PRD criterion 10.
- **SPEC-21 ★ Voice-retrieval eval** — VWP-FR-026. Scored utterance set → expected tool
  calls + result sets (resolution, ambiguity, out-of-domain, abstention); thresholds set
  before tickets freeze; runs before any demo line is rehearsed.
- **SPEC-22 STT integration** — VWP-FR-027. Vendor per VWP-D-02; preflight; typed
  fallback UI; keyterms wired both vendors' way until decided.

### Cross-cutting

- **SPEC-23 ★ Demo mode** — VWP-FR-034. Preflight (STT + inference box), prewarm, cached
  golden path incl. last-resort cached scan results, timeouts, degraded states, demo-day
  venue/topology checklist. Acceptance: PRD criterion 11.
- **NFR-5 licensing containment** applies to SPEC-04/05/16 artifacts: per-source raw +
  derived isolation with deletion lineage; PRD criterion 12 rehearses one source removal.

## 3. Spike register (all run before tickets freeze — synthesis D9)

| # | Spike | Feeds | Decides |

| 3 | Wine-Searcher trial + ~~GWS~~ coverage on ~50 LWIN'd wines + written quotes — *GWS dropped 2026-08-25: domain parked/for-sale, no live API surface (evidence in `2026-08-25-spike-resources-status.md`); critic layer = WS aggregate + X-Wines community* | SPEC-16 | paid-tier viability |
| 4 | X-Wines/WineSensed join rates + X-Wines image manifest count — *datasets downloaded + MD5-verified 2026-08-25 (external `terroir-data` dataset workspace); manifest half ANSWERED: X-Wines Full publishes NO label images (author on-demand only; Slim = 1,007); WineSensed 996,808 image refs in a 35 GB undownloaded archive. Join-rate half runnable now* | SPEC-04/16 | corpus expectations |
| 5 | DDGS 500-query soak — **CLOSED 2026-08-25** (`2026-08-25-spike-05-ddgs-soak.md`) | SPEC-04 | **viable cascade tier: 94.0 % ok / 0 empty over 500; transient timeout runs ≤ 3 force mandatory per-query retry (~30 s backoff) into SPEC-04** |
| 6 | e2e scan latency on demo hardware (cold/warm/concurrent p50/p95) — **CLOSED 2026-08-25** (`2026-08-25-spike-06-scan-latency.md`) | SPEC-05 | **RTX 4090-class box sufficient: warm e2e p50 0.18 s, ~5 req/s saturated; cold start ≈ 35 s makes SPEC-23 prewarm a quantified hard requirement; cached reference SuperPoint features become an index artifact** |
| 7 | Phone-photo vs. packshot LightGlue survival — **7a (synthetic) CLOSED 2026-08-25** (`2026-08-25-spike-07a-lightglue-survival.md`); **7b (real phone photos) OPEN — needs Devin's captures** | SPEC-03/05 | **rerank viable: LightGlue separates true/wrong perfectly across all degradations (worst true 37 vs wrong median ≤22 inliers); failure mode is candidate nomination (combo: 73 % top-1) → arms-union topology confirmed by measurement** |
| 8 | Assisted-grid UX flow (+ separate auto-grid feasibility) | SPEC-12 | v1 contract fit |
| 9 | Voice-retrieval eval construction — **CLOSED 2026-08-25, eval constructed + baselined** (`2026-08-25-spike-09-voice-retrieval-eval.md`) | SPEC-21 | **viable; forces producer-corroboration/margin rule into the resolver** |
| 10 | Partner-CSV GTIN coverage + vintage-uniqueness | SPEC-05 | VWP-D-07 barcode arm |
| 11 | `wine_lineages` status (deprecated vs. still-read; note eval F-2) | SPEC-01/24 | VWP-D-05 |

**Spike 1 — CLOSED 2026-08-25 (700 live transcriptions + 192 full-catalog resolutions;
adversarially audited by GPT-5.6 Sol, all corrections applied).** **VWP-D-02 =
AssemblyAI (Universal-3.5 Pro) — committed for the demo phase, provisional for
production** pending a small human/noisy/streaming validation. The decision rests on
the audit-prescribed metric: resolution correctness against the full 211k catalog,
utterance-clustered — AssemblyAI +18.8 pp naive / +17.2 pp producer-gated over corrected Deepgram (p = 0.009 naive,
p = 0.042 producer-gated). Findings that bind the specs: (a) **hot-list selection** —
Deepgram measured ceiling 75 phrases / 124 words (500-token cap); AssemblyAI accepted
93/156, documented to 1,000 words; nobody primes a 20k list. (b) **The dangerous
failure is the plausible-but-wrong transcript, now measured**: naive threshold
resolution misidentifies across producers at 31–50 %; a producer-corroboration gate
cuts that to 6–8 % (at 34–50 % abstention) — that gate is now a SPEC-21 requirement.
Empty transcripts (Deepgram `language=en`: 42 % of native clips; `multi` fixes it) are
the cheap detectable guard, mapped to abstention. (c) **Accent folding is a hard
requirement**: live pg_trgm shows accented-query-vs-ASCII-catalog at 0.294, below
match_lwin's 0.3 threshold, and match_lwin does not fold. All numbers are clean-TTS
oracle-primed upper bounds; scorer validated byte-exact against live pg_trgm (203
pairs, max delta 0.000000).

**Spike 9 — CLOSED 2026-08-25 (constructed + baselined).** 206 cases / 250-item fixture
from the production LWIN catalog; queries are spike 1's REAL AssemblyAI transcripts, so
degradation is measured, not synthetic. Naive trigram baseline separates STT configs
(92 % vs 81 % resolution) — the eval measures the pipeline end-to-end. Binding finding:
with a *perfect* transcript of an out-of-inventory wine ("Brunello di Montalcino from
Biondi-Santi"), the resolver false-accepts another producer's Brunello at 0.53 —
appellation vocabulary swamps producer signal, the same shared-vocabulary failure the
P2 round-5 critic proved at the identity gate (Pichon Baron/Lalande, 0.55). SPEC-21's
resolver therefore requires producer-token corroboration or a top-1/top-2 margin rule,
never a bare similarity threshold; out-of-inventory false-accept rate and
empty-transcript rate become gated metrics in the eval YAML.

**Spike 11 — CLOSED 2026-08-24 (repo evidence).** `wine_lineages` is LIVE, not
deprecated: tenant-scoped (`restaurant_id NOT NULL`, per-restaurant LWIN7/name-norm
unique keys — it is NOT a cross-tenant identity layer), created by a security-definer
BEFORE trigger on every wine-creation path, and read by real product surface
(cellar grouping, reconcile-queue, `merge_wines` — which rejects cross-vintage merges,
consistent with edition-grain doctrine). Meanwhile `canonical_wines`/`wine_variants` are
read only by the import path, `src/domains/identity/*`, and tests — the live UI still
runs on `wines` + `wine_lineages`. **Verdict (VWP-D-05, evidence-forced): KEEP-READ.**
Lineages are a tenant-side display grouping at canonical grain over the legacy `wines`
table; they do not collide with `wine_editions` (which attaches to the P2 spine), so
0112 is NOT blocked. Constraints recorded into SPEC-01: the editions backfill must not
treat lineage rows as canonical truth (their LWIN7 derivation is trigger-heuristic, with
ambiguous rows deliberately left unlinked — that pattern is precedent for the quarantine
queue, not a resolution source). Follow-up (backlog, not this phase): derive UI grouping
from variant→canonical linkage and retire the parallel lineage trigger. Exposed by this
spike: the `wines` ↔ `wine_variants` bridge (which table the demo UI's inventory rows
live on) must be stated in SPEC-05/11's ticket specs, since scan output and bottle detail
bind to the P2 spine while today's UI reads `wines`.

## 4. What tickets wait on

1. Owner approves the PRD (and with it this spec list + manifest).
2. Spikes 1–11 run; their verdicts recorded against VWP-D-02/05/06/07 and folded into the
   affected specs.
3. Owner confirms Gate 0 thresholds (VWP-D-01) and the 20k ingestion path (VWP-D-04).
4. The eval YAML (`docs/evals/` addition, EV-VWP-* IDs per slice, repo given/then format)
   is authored from the ★ specs' acceptance criteria — the PRD's 13 criteria decompose
   into per-slice evals at that point, each becoming a failing test first.

Ticket grain then follows repo convention: one branch per opportunity-sized slice,
e2e-tagged, landing only when its evals and global gates are green.
