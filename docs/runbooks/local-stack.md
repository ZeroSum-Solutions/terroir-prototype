# Local Supabase Stack

Fully local, Docker-backed Supabase stack for this worktree. Nothing here
ever talks to hosted Supabase — see "Safety model" below.

## Bring-up

```bash
scripts/local/dev-stack.sh
```

Idempotent — safe to re-run. It will:

1. Create `.env.local` from `.env.local.example` if missing.
2. Refuse to continue if the configured Supabase URL isn't local
   (`scripts/local/assert-local-db.sh`).
3. `supabase start` (no-op if already running).
4. `supabase db reset` — drops and recreates the local DB, applying every
   migration in `supabase/migrations/` from scratch.
5. Wait for the API to actually be ready (see "Post-reset readiness"
   below) before touching it.
6. Seed the dev-login bypass user (`scripts/local/seed-local.mjs`).
7. Print connection info and next steps.

Then boot the app against it:

```bash
scripts/local/dev-local.sh
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/dev-login   # expect a 30x + session cookies
```

`pnpm test:e2e` uses the same guarded wrapper and starts a fresh server. It does
not reuse an unrelated process already listening on port 3000. The local auth
configuration allows 100 OTP verifications per five minutes because the full
suite performs more than the Supabase default of 30 dev-login verifications.

## Post-reset readiness

`supabase db reset` restarts the `auth` (GoTrue) container, which gets a new
internal Docker IP. Kong (the local API gateway) can keep routing
`/auth/v1/*` to the STALE IP for a few seconds afterward, returning
transient `502`s — which can break the seed step (or any test run) that
starts immediately after bring-up.

`dev-stack.sh` closes this race: after `supabase db reset` and before
seeding, it polls `http://127.0.0.1:57321/auth/v1/health` and
`http://127.0.0.1:57321/rest/v1/` (with the local anon/publishable key from
`.env.local`) until both return `200`, for up to ~30s. If it sees `502`s
persist past a few seconds, it automatically runs `docker restart` once on
this repo's Kong container (name derived from `supabase/config.toml`'s
`project_id`, e.g. `supabase_kong_terroir-vw-local`) to clear the stale
upstream IP, then keeps polling within the same overall timeout. If the API
still isn't healthy by the deadline, `dev-stack.sh` exits non-zero with a
loud message instead of seeding against a possibly-broken stack.

## Live-test identity conservation

Use `scripts/run-live-test-conservation.mjs` to wrap live Vitest files that
create database fixtures. Before invocation, the process environment must
contain local values for these three names:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

The runner calls `scripts/local/assert-local-db.sh`, then queries the exact local
container `supabase_db_terroir-vw-local`. It snapshots identity sets before the
child starts and again after the child returns, signals, throws, or fails to
spawn. The child always receives `CI=1`. The wrapper exits non-zero when the
local guard, either snapshot, the child command, or identity comparison fails.

Run it with Node 20, pnpm 9, and one Vitest worker. List the intended live test
files explicitly:

```bash
mise exec node@20 -- node scripts/run-live-test-conservation.mjs -- \
  corepack pnpm@9 exec vitest run src/domains/import/p3-live.test.ts \
  --maxWorkers=1
```

The snapshot covers exact identities in six tables: `auth.users`,
`restaurants`, `workspaces`, `memberships`, `workspace_memberships`, and
`inventory_command_receipts` (the last uses restaurant/operation ID pairs). It
does not compare row contents, other tables, or the whole database. The CLI also
does not prove that a broader requested test inventory ran or that Vitest
reported zero skipped tests. Gates that need those claims must verify the exact
file set and result counts separately.

## Teardown

```bash
supabase stop
```

Data lives in a Docker volume and survives `supabase stop` / `supabase
start` cycles. To wipe it, run `supabase db reset` again (or `supabase stop
--no-backup` to drop the volume entirely).

## Ports

This repo's `supabase/config.toml` uses `project_id = "terroir-vw-local"`
and a `573xx` port block instead of the supabase-cli defaults (`543xx`),
because other local Supabase stacks for sibling worktrees/projects on this
machine already occupy `543xx`, `553xx`, and `563xx`. If you see a port
conflict, check `docker ps` for other `supabase_*` containers before
assuming this stack is broken.

| Service          | Port  |
|------------------|-------|
| API (Kong)       | 57321 |
| Postgres         | 57322 |
| Studio           | 57323 |
| Inbucket/Mailpit | 57324 |
| Analytics        | 57327 |
| DB pooler        | 57329 |
| DB shadow (diff) | 57320 |

## Seed data

`scripts/local/seed-local.mjs` is intentionally minimal: it ensures the
dev-login user (`DEV_BYPASS_EMAIL`, default `devlocal@terroir.test`) exists
and has a restaurant + owner membership, via the existing
`handle_new_user()` signup trigger
(`supabase/migrations/0001_auth_boundary.sql`). That's enough for
`/api/dev-login` to land in a working, empty venue. It's safe to re-run —
it no-ops if the user and membership already exist.

For a richer dataset (250 wines, invoice scans, inventory, wine lists, pour
history, etc.) for manual QA or demo purposes, see `docs/LOCAL-SUPABASE.md`
and run `pnpm run supabase:seed:local:apply` afterward — that script seeds
its own set of users (`owner+local@terroir.test` etc.) against the
deterministic restaurant id documented there. The two seeds are
independent and can both be applied to the same local DB. `LOCAL-SUPABASE.md`
is canonical for that seed script's contents and usage only — this doc
remains canonical for the stack's ports, bring-up, and safety model.

## Safety model

- Nothing in `scripts/local/` can reach the hosted production Supabase
  project.
- `scripts/local/assert-local-db.sh` is a hard gate: it reads
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (env, falling back to `.env.local`) and exits
  non-zero unless it matches exactly THIS repo's local API endpoint —
  `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` on the port `supabase/config.toml`'s `[api]`
  section declares (`57321`). It deliberately does not accept "any"
  localhost port, because other local Supabase stacks for sibling
  worktrees/projects on this machine occupy their own `543xx`/`553xx`/
  `563xx` port blocks. Every script that mutates the local DB sources it
  first — see `scripts/local/assert-local-db.test.sh` for the probe matrix.
- `scripts/seed-local-supabase.mjs` (the richer demo seed, run via `pnpm run
  supabase:seed:local:apply`) requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` to be set
  explicitly — no hardcoded fallback — and runs the same
  `assert-local-db.sh` gate before any write.
- `.env.local` is gitignored and is created fresh per-worktree — it is
  never copied from another checkout. `.env.local.example` commits the
  well-known local supabase-cli default keys (anon/publishable +
  service-role), which are public constants for local dev, not secrets.
- Local-only CLI operations: `supabase init | start | stop | status | db
  reset`. Never `supabase db push` or `supabase link` from these scripts —
  those talk to a hosted project and are out of scope for anything under
  `scripts/local/`.
- `scripts/backup/*` and `scripts/restore-drill.mjs` are NOT wired to this
  local stack — they hard-require the supabase-cli default DB port
  (`54322`) and fail closed against this repo's `57322` port, so backup/
  restore drills against this stack aren't currently possible. That's safe
  (they refuse rather than run against the wrong database) but means those
  drills need separate follow-up if this local stack is meant to exercise
  them.
