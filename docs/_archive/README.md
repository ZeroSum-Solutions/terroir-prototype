# Archive — historical evidence only

Nothing in this directory describes the current system. These files are retained as
a record of how the project got here, and several of them contain claims the code now
contradicts. **Do not use anything here to answer a question about how Terroir works
today.**

Current authorities:

| Question | Authority |
|---|---|
| What is the architecture? | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| What are the conventions? | `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` |
| What is built and shipped? | `docs/feature-ledger.json` |
| What does the design system say? | `DESIGN.md` (repo root) |
| How do I work in this repo? | `AGENTS.md` (repo root) |

## Retained record and retired history

The generated snapshots below were removed from the checkout on September 5, 2026. Their links resolve to the retained Git history. Plain filenames below remain in this directory.

| File | Was | Why archived |
|---|---|---|
| [PROJECT.md](https://github.com/ZeroSum-Solutions/terroir/blob/abdc661abde43b0ac70a81f740b61d21da7e414b/docs/_archive/PROJECT.md) | Auto-generated "Project Ledger" | Tool output, not hand-maintained; orphaned — linked from nothing. Redundant with `package.json` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. |
| `2026-08-21-camera-first-personal-cellar-inventory.md` | Discovery input | Self-labeled "not yet approved for implementation"; superseded by the same-day PRD and by `docs/plans/2026-08-28-camera-first-decisions-recorded.md`. |
| [Generated scaffold snapshot](https://github.com/ZeroSum-Solutions/terroir/tree/abdc661abde43b0ac70a81f740b61d21da7e414b/docs/_archive/planning-codebase-2026-05-01) | Machine-generated scaffold snapshot (5 files) | Generated once on 2026-05-01 and never touched. Predates `src/domains/` and `src/adapters/` entirely. Known false claims: describes a `src/lib`-only tree; names class-variance-authority as the variant convention (CVA is not in this repo); states "no destructive down migrations" when `downs:check` in fact *requires* paired downs; gives the dead `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. The still-true parts were salvaged into `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` before archiving. |

## Deliberately NOT archived

`app_spec.txt` and `claude-progress.txt` stay at the repo root despite reading like
stale documents, because **they are machine-read**:

- `scripts/verify-feature-ledger.mjs:15` sets `SOURCE_FILE = "app_spec.txt"` and the
  ledger asserts `sourceFile must be app_spec.txt`. It is the requirement source for
  a CI gate, not a narrative spec.
- `src/lib/feature-ledger/verify-feature-ledger.test.ts` reads both files by path.

Moving either breaks the merge gate. They were moved here on 2026-08-29 and moved
straight back when `pnpm verify:feature-ledger` went red. Their *prose* is drifted —
`app_spec.txt` names the dead env var `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and points at
directories that do not exist — but their *structure* is load-bearing. Correct the
drift in place if you correct it at all; do not relocate them.
