// ARCH-013: single source of truth for "which restaurant is active
// for this user on this request". Previously getAuthContext (used by
// AppLayout to drive the nav + RestaurantProvider) used
// .limit(1).single() with no ordering, and requireMembership (used by
// every API route) used a cookie-first / created_at-DESC fallback.
// For a user with two memberships the two helpers could disagree,
// leaving the shell showing one restaurant while API calls targeted
// another. Both now route through resolveActiveMembership so they
// always pick the same one.
