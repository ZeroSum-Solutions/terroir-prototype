/**
 * How a corpus photograph is captioned and described, wherever it is shown.
 *
 * A corpus photograph is only sometimes a photograph of THIS wine (0138), so
 * showing one silently would put a stranger's Chianti under this bottle's
 * name. Every kind but "label" is captioned with what it actually is, and the
 * alt text degrades the same way — a screen reader must not be told the row's
 * producer over a picture of somebody else's.
 *
 * This lived inside the full-detail view. The cellar drawer needed the same
 * rule (GLOBAL-04 — it used to render no image at all when `hero_image_url`
 * was null, which is most of the corpus), and two copies of a rule this
 * careful is how the careful half gets lost.
