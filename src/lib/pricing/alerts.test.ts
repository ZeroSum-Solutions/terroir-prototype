/**
 * The defect this file exists for.
 *
 * `fetchPricingAlerts` filtered two tables with `.in("wine_id", wineIds)`
 * carrying EVERY eligible wine. PostgREST puts an `.in()` filter in the URL, so
 * on the 250-wine seed the query string reached 9,262 characters and the server
 * answered **HTTP 414 URI Too Long** — measured against the running stack, not
 * estimated.
 *
 * It was invisible because `insights/page.tsx` calls this behind
 * `.catch(() => [])`: the Pricing Review card simply never mounted, and the
 * larger the restaurant the more certain it was to be missing. A cellar big
 * enough to need pricing review was exactly the one that could not get it.
 *
 * These tests assert the request SHAPE rather than the row output, because the
 * shape is the bug: no single request may carry an unbounded id list.
