// SD-41 — the preview's blank-producer gate.
//
// This replaces a `role="status"` panel that counted producer-less rows and
// warned about them without requiring anything of anyone. That warning is
// how 1,277 wines were written with an empty producer and the producer name
// buried in `name`; 321 of them are still unrepaired in production. See
// src/domains/import/producer-acknowledgement.ts for why an acknowledgement
// — rather than a rejection or a silent write-time repair — is the right
// shape here, and note that the SERVER is what actually enforces it: this
// checkbox is the affordance, not the guard.
