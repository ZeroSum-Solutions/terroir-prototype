          to persist it — migrations are locked), so getImportSessionProgress's
          allChunksPresent stays permanently false for this session's
          declared_chunk_total. Reaching this block at all guarantees
          every OTHER chunk already got a server-confirmed batch (the
          confirm loop this session was created from only ever reaches
          "session" once every chunk in the plan is confirmed or
          skipped) — so the honest, always-true summary is "all other
