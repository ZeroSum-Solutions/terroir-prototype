/**
 * GLOBAL-01 — the scan-history scope control, as ONE control.
 *
 * This was four `flex-wrap` pills carrying a label and a count. Measured on the
 * running app at 390px (e2e/one-row-rule.test.ts): All 65px, Complete 101px,
 * Processing 107px, Failed 82px — 355px of pill plus 24px of gaps against 354px
 * of usable row, so "Failed" wrapped onto a second visual line (three chips at
 * y=275, the fourth at y=327). One `flex-wrap` element, one source row, two rows
 * to the eye — which is the count Devin's rule is written about, and the shape
 * `scripts/check-control-rows.mjs` says in its own header it cannot see.
 *
 * The fix is `src/app/(app)/cellar/cellar-counters.tsx`'s, for the same reason:
 * the strip's width is DATA-dependent — every count is a live number and
 * "Processing" gets wider the moment it reads 1,024 — so no breakpoint can be
 * right. A `<select>` is constant-width whatever the data, and it is the rule's
 * own answer: four controls becoming one.
 *
 * Nothing is lost. Each option still carries its count, and the active filter is
 * on screen at all times, which is all the pills showed.
