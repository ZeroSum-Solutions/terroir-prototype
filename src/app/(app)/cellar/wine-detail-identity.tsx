/**
 * CELLAR-05/06 — the wine, at the top of its own drawer.
 *
 * Devin, on the old drawer: "There's no information on the wine. There's no
 * hero image of the wine." The drawer led with stock counts and then handed
 * most of its height to a stock-adjustment form; the bottle appeared only when
 * the tenant had uploaded a photograph, which is the minority case.
 *
 * Two things changed here:
 *   • The picture is always present. A wine with no photograph of its own
 *     falls back to the X-Wines corpus image its identity link points at
 *     (GLOBAL-04), captioned with what that picture actually is, and then to
 *     the same producer-initials stand-in every cellar row already uses.
 *   • It follows DESIGN.md's imagery rule — 2:3 portrait at radius `lg` with a
 *     glass hairline, object-contain — instead of the 2:1 banner crop the
 *     design contract calls out by name for cutting the tops off bottles.
 *
 * The identity LINK is not the only way to a picture, and for a cellar built
 * by CSV import it is not the usual one. When neither the tenant's own
 * photograph nor the embedded corpus image exists, this asks the profile route
 * for the one wine on screen — the fetch the list page cannot afford per row.
