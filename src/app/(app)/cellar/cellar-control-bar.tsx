/**
 * CELLAR-01 / GLOBAL-01 — the Cellar's single control row, and every control
 * in it inside the frame.
 *
 * This replaced four stacked rows. It then spent a release failing the other
 * half of the same rule: measured at 390px it held TEN controls, of which
 * three were on screen and seven sat 740px off to the right inside an
 * `overflow-x-auto`. Both gates passed — the static ratchet counts rows, and
 * the page's own `scrollWidth` never grew because the row swallowed the
 * overflow. "If you cannot fit all the buttons horizontally in one frame,
 * then there are too many buttons" is a claim about controls, not about
 * containers, so the row no longer scrolls: what does not fit is demoted.
 *
 * Measured at 390px, usable row width 354px:
 *   scope pills   424px (4 counters; ~670px with 6)  → ONE select
 *   Open bottles  118px  ┐
 *   Reconcile     173px  ├ contextual, `sm:`+ pills; on a phone they are the
 *   Cellar sett.  124px  ┘ first entries of the overflow menu
 *   Filters        86px  → stays: it is the page's one facet surface
 *   List|Grid      88px  → ONE toggle button, 44px, labelled for the view it
 *                          switches TO (CELLAR-08 keeps the bin grid reachable
 *                          on a phone, so it cannot be demoted into the menu —
 *                          a menu item is not visible until the menu opens)
 *   ────────────────────
 *   phone total   ~318px of 354px, with the scope select absorbing the slack.
 *
 * Search is deliberately NOT here: GLOBAL-02 exempts it from the rule and puts
 * it above, on its own, at the top of the page.
