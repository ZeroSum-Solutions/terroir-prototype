  // (the auditor constructed one). Concatenating into one hash INPUT can
  // never be made safe by picking a "safer" separator; the fix is to
  // never let a bare-file digest and an overrides-bearing digest share
  // the same STRING FORMAT at all. So: hash the file and the canonical
  // overrides JSON SEPARATELY, then join them with the OVERRIDES_DIGEST_STEM
  // (contains ":", which never appears in a bare hex digest) into a
  // string that cannot equal any bare 64-char-hex digest by construction
  // — not by hoping no file's bytes happen to collide. content_sha256 is
  // `text` in the DB (supabase/schema.snapshot.sql), not a fixed-length
  // column, so there is no length constraint forcing this into 64 hex
  // characters; the readable, unambiguous form is used instead.
  // canonicalizeRowOverrides fixes key order (numeric row order, then
  // CANONICAL_HEADERS field order) so one override SET always hashes
  // identically regardless of client-side object key order.
  //
  // Item 2 (per-row LWIN match visibility/rejection): rejectedLwinRows is a
  // SECOND, independent thing that changes this confirm's effective
  // content — two requests for the same file and the same (or no)
  // overrides but DIFFERENT rejected matches must not collide as "the same
  // upload" either, for the identical reason overrides don't (§2.2's
  // resume/dedup logic would otherwise silently resume the wrong set of
  // rejections). Three cases, by whether either extra is present:
  //   - neither present  -> the bare fileDigestHex, byte-for-byte UNCHANGED
  //     from before this feature existed.
  //   - overrides only   -> `overrides-v1:<sha256(overridesJson)>:<fileDigestHex>`,
  //     byte-for-byte UNCHANGED from before this feature existed — real
  //     batches already exist in exactly this shape.
  //   - rejections present (with or without overrides too), but no
  //     approved-match set -> a NEW, previously-unwritten
  //     `overrides-v2:<sha256(combinedJson)>:<fileDigestHex>` namespace,
  //     folding both extras into one canonical blob (canonicalizeConfirmExtras)
  //     so a confirm that changes EITHER one hashes differently.
  //     Namespacing rejections onto v1 instead (rather than minting v2)
  //     would make an overrides-only confirm and a rejections-only confirm
  //     of the same file indistinguishable from each other whenever their
  //     combined JSON happened to canonicalize the same length — v2 avoids
  //     that ambiguity by construction, at the cost of one more namespace
  //     every downstream reader must recognize (see OVERRIDES_DIGEST_STEM's
  //     own comment for where).
  //   - an approved-match set present (BLOCK 2, Sol audit round 3 finding 2,
  //     with or without overrides/rejections too) -> a THIRD,
  //     previously-unwritten `overrides-v3:<sha256(combinedJson)>:<fileDigestHex>`
  //     namespace (canonicalizeConfirmExtrasV3), for the identical reason
  //     v2 exists: two requests differing only in which lwin_id the
  //     operator approved must not collide as "the same upload" either.
  //     v3 is minted rather than reusing/extending v2's shape so every
  //     already-written v2 digest (rejections, no approvals) keeps hashing
  //     exactly as it always has — see canonicalizeConfirmExtrasV3's own
  //     comment for why it's a separate function, not a 3rd argument
  //     bolted onto canonicalizeConfirmExtras.
  //   - BLOCK 1 (round 5 fix): an approved-match set present but EMPTY (or
  //     every entry malformed — impossible in practice, since
  //     checkApprovedLwinRows above already rejects the whole confirm on a
  //     malformed entry, but canonicalizeApprovedLwinRows' own null-collapse
  //     is written to treat it identically to `{}` regardless) -> a FOURTH,

  //     round: the pre-fix client only ever sent approvedLwinRows when
  //     non-empty (buildApprovedLwinRows' own `if (Object.keys(...).length >
  //     0)` guard, since removed — see import-client.tsx). It now means
  //     something the v1/v2 tiers' own "no approvedLwinRows" null-collapse
  //     never had to mean: "the operator's preview showed zero linking
  //     matches, and applyLwinApprovalVeto's fail-closed veto is engaged for
  //     this confirm" — a REAL difference in what gets WRITTEN relative to a
  //     v1/v2/bare confirm of the identical file/overrides/rejections (where

    // mismatch in that case "can only stem from rowOverrides." That
    // reasoning is FALSE: an OMITTING caller (neither field set,
    // `hasLwinApprovalSignal` false) can still be resumed onto a candidate
    // whose OWN digest is v2/v3/v4-namespaced — i.e. a candidate that
    // itself encodes a PRIOR confirm's LWIN approvals/rejections. Silently
    // resuming it hands out that old batch's stale LWIN-linked rows,
    // bypassing whatever this confirm's own (omitted-signal) re-match
    // would have decided, with no signal to the caller at all.
    //
    // The contract, corrected: resume is refused whenever the digests
    // disagree AND *either* side of the comparison could hold an LWIN
    // decision the other side never agreed to —
    //   - `hasLwinApprovalSignal`: THIS confirm's own request carries an
    //     approval/rejection decision (unchanged from round-28), or
    //   - `digestTierEncodesLwinState(preCheck.match.content_sha256)`: the
    //     CANDIDATE's own digest tier (v2/v3/v4) encodes a decision from
    //     WHATEVER confirm originally minted it, regardless of what this
    //     request carries.
    // Only when NEITHER holds — this request carries no LWIN signal AND
    // the candidate is bare-or-v1-tier, meaning its digest cannot encode
    // an LWIN decision at all — can a mismatch be proven to stem from
    // rowOverrides alone. That is exactly the pre-existing,
    // separately-audited "resume across override formats" idempotency
    // feature, and it still resumes exactly as before.
    //
    // Refused as the SAME conflict shape reconcileLiveBatchesForFile itself

    // error naming the condition, resolved by the operator reverting the
    // stale batch from Recent imports before confirming this version —

    // batch here (which would only chase the exact same conflict through
    // the POST-check SEER-YIELDS path below, at the cost of a wasted

  //
  // Round-4 audit finding 1: the previous version of this comment claimed
  // a deterministic (created_at, id) total order picks a single survivor.
  // That is WRONG — created_at is the row's INSERT-TRANSACTION-START time
  // (effectively `now()`), not commit order, and under read-committed a
  // transaction that starts first can still commit last. Concretely: A
  // starts first (earlier created_at) but commits slowly; B starts later,
  // commits first, runs its post-check, sees nothing committed yet (A
  // hasn't committed), and survives; A then commits, runs its post-check,
  // sees B — but the (created_at, id) rule said A was "older", so A
  // ALSO survived. Two live batches, precisely the bug this function
  // exists to prevent.
  //
  // The fix is the unconditional SEER-YIELDS rule: any confirm whose
  // post-create check observes ANY rival live batch over the same
  // underlying file reverts ITSELF, full stop — no timestamp comparison,
  // no "who is older" logic at all.
  //
  // Why this can never leave two survivors, under every interleaving:
  // each request's post-check runs strictly AFTER its own insert has
  // committed (the very next thing this function does, in the same
  // request, using the same connection). Consider two racing confirms A
  // and B. A batch survives ONLY if its own post-check sees no rival —
  // i.e. the rival's insert had not yet committed when this batch's
  // post-check ran. Suppose (for contradiction) BOTH A and B survive:
  // then A's post-check ran before B's commit, AND B's post-check ran
  // before A's commit. But A's own commit precedes A's post-check
  // (same request, sequential) precedes B's commit (assumed) — so A's
  // commit precedes B's commit. Symmetrically B's commit precedes A's
  // commit. Both can't hold at once, so at most one of A/B can have seen
  // no rival — at most one survivor, for any two-way race, and by the
  // same pairwise argument for any N-way race (a batch only survives if
  // NO other rival was already committed when its own post-check ran,
  // and the earliest committer is the only batch that can possibly
  // satisfy that for every other rival).
  //
  // The residual: it is possible for BOTH post-checks to see each other
  // (A's post-check happens to run after B's commit, and vice versa —
  // e.g. both inserts commit before either post-check starts). Then BOTH
  // self-revert unconditionally, under this rule — zero survivors, never
  // two. A retry from either client then re-enters this function from
  // scratch and hits the ordinary PRE-check, which resolves against
  // whichever batch (if any) is now the sole survivor.
  //
  // Round-5 audit finding 1 — SCOPE of the proof above: "at most one
  // survivor" is proven for every interleaving of two SUCCESSFUL
  // post-checks. It says nothing about a post-check that itself FAILS
  // (a lookup error, not "no rival found") — that is a distinct case,
  // handled explicitly below by selfRevertAndRetry: a failure to verify
  // is treated exactly like a rival was actually seen, never like "no
  // rival, safe to survive". Every path out of this function past the
  // insert — success, sees a rival, or can't tell — either returns a
  // survivor whose post-check genuinely saw no rival, or reverts-BEFORE-
  // returning. A single failure (the post-check call, or the revert it
  // triggers) can therefore never itself produce two live survivors; it
  // can only ever leave OUR OWN batch live (see selfRevertAndRetry's own
  // comment for that residual) or ask for a retry.
  //
  // Round-5 audit finding 7: this residual — and the "both self-revert"
  // case above — assume retries are HUMAN-triggered, arriving with
  // natural timing jitter (a page reload, a re-click), not two processes
  // racing to resubmit in lockstep. Two literally-simultaneous automated
  // retries COULD repeat a zero-survivor round again — that is still
  // SAFE (never a duplicate, just another round of the same protocol) and
  // converges given any real-world timing variance between the two
  // retries; it is not a scenario this codebase needs to engineer around.

/** Self-revert OUR just-created batch and hand back the retryable

 * whether we can PROVE a rival exists (postCheck.match) or merely CAN'T
 * PROVE we're clear (the postCheck lookup itself failed) — an inability to
 * verify is not evidence of safety, so it's treated exactly like seeing a
 * rival, never like "no rival, safe to survive".
 *
 * Nothing has applied yet — apply only ever starts after confirm returns —
 * so undoing our own batch is always safe. import_batches/import_batch_rows
 * both have DELETE REVOKEd from `authenticated` (0076) and migrations are
 * locked for this fix, so a literal DELETE is out of reach; revert_import_batch
 * (already TS-layer-reachable, and — per the auditor — migration 0109
 * permits reverting a batch that was only just created, since its guard is
 * "status <> reverted", not "status = completed") is the equivalent move
 * here — it flips our batch to status='reverted' (0 rows to revert, since
 * nothing was ever applied), which every live-batch lookup in this file
 * already treats as gone via .neq("status","reverted"): functionally
 * indistinguishable from deleted to every future confirm.
 *
 * Round-6 audit finding 1: retries the revert call ONCE, immediately, if
 * the first attempt fails — a transient failure (a dropped connection, a
 * momentary lock conflict) is far more likely than a durable one, and a
 * successful second attempt fully closes the orphan instead of leaving it
 * for a later confirm to stumble onto. If BOTH attempts fail, this now
 * returns the SAME retryable duplicate_race_retry a successful revert
 * does, never the old, distinct duplicate_check_failed code — see the
 * proof below for why that convergence is correct, not merely convenient.
 *
 * FAILURE-ATOMICITY, corrected again (round-6 finding 1, round-7 finding 1,
 * then HONESTY-CORRECTED round-10/round-11): earlier versions of this
 * comment claimed the invariant this file maintains is "at most one live
 * batch [for a given underlying file] at any time," then narrowed that
 * (round-7) to "at most one live batch is ever APPLIED per underlying
 * file," with points 3-4 below describing reconciliation as actively
 * choosing a survivor and reverting every other live candidate to make
 * that hold. Round 10 deleted that authority entirely — see
 * reconcileLiveBatchesForFile's own comment: it now NEVER calls
 * revertImportBatch, only reads and reports. With 0 or 1 live candidates
 * it resumes the match; with 2 or more it returns a terminal
 * multiple_live_batches error naming every candidate ITS OWN LOOKUP FOUND
 * (findLiveBatchesByUnderlyingFile is capped at LIVE_BATCH_LOOKUP_LIMIT —
 * WARN 5, round-13 audit — so this is "every candidate within that cap,"
 * not a literal guarantee of completeness beyond it) and leaves ALL of
 * them live — recovery is an operator reverting by hand from Recent
 * imports (round-27 audit: it lists every non-reverted batch for the
 * restaurant, not just the ten newest). So neither older claim holds any more: this
 * file does not guarantee at most one live batch, and does not guarantee
 * at most one applied batch either — that would-be guarantee is what
 * findSiblingWithAppliedRows' own comment now documents as a NARROWED
 * race, not a closed one (0108 locks only its own batch's row; two
 * sibling applies can still both pass that guard and both persist
 * inventory).
 *
 * What THIS function's own failure mode actually leaves behind:
 *   1. Applying a batch requires a CLIENT holding that batch's own id (the
 *      apply endpoint is called with a specific batchId) — apply is never
 *      driven by a server-side scan that could stumble onto B on its own.
 *   2. B's own client (the request that failed to create/self-revert it)
 *      never received a batchId to apply: every path that reaches this
 *      function returns an ERROR for that request (never
 *      `{ ok: true, batchId: B }`). HONESTY-CORRECTED (round-13 audit,
 *      BLOCK 3): earlier wording concluded from this that "no client
 *      anywhere holds a pointer to B" — false. GET /api/import/batches
 *      lists every live batch for the restaurant with no per-creator
 *      filter (api/import/batches/route.ts's getBatches), and the import
 *      UI's own Recent imports section renders every one of them (round-27
 *      audit: no longer capped at the newest ten) with an Open/Apply
 *      affordance (RecentImports, import-client.tsx) — any authenticated
 *      member of this restaurant can reach and open B that way, not only
 *      via a later confirm's own pre-check (point 3, below).
 *   3. A revert-failure here leaves B live alongside whatever rival (A)
 *      it lost to. The NEXT confirm attempt for the SAME underlying file,
 *      by any client, re-enters reconcileLiveBatchesForFile's pre-check,
 *      which now sees 2 (or more) live candidates for the file and
 *      returns the terminal multiple_live_batches conflict — it does NOT
 *      pick a survivor or revert anything automatically. B does not
 *      resolve itself; an operator has to revert it (or A) by hand from
 *      Recent imports (point 2).
 * A revert-failure orphan is still not, by itself, a data hazard.
 * HONESTY-CORRECTED (round-13 audit, BLOCK 3): this is NOT because B is
 * unreachable — it is reachable (point 2) — it's because the safeguards
 * that actually matter here don't depend on that. Reconciliation still
 * never auto-picks a survivor once 2+ live candidates exist for the file
 * (returns the terminal multiple_live_batches conflict instead, same as
 * any other multi-candidate conflict), and findSiblingWithAppliedRows' own
 * apply-time guard (see its own comment) refuses to apply ANY batch for a
 * file — B included — once a sibling already has applied rows. A member
 * who opens B from Recent imports and applies it either hits that guard or
 * legitimately applies it as the surviving import for that file, exactly
 * like resolving any other multiple_live_batches conflict by hand — never
 * a distinct hazard unique to a revert-failure orphan. (The distinct
 * hazard that CAN cause the same underlying content to be applied twice —
 * two sibling batches both applying concurrently — is the narrower race
 * findSiblingWithAppliedRows' own comment documents; it is unrelated to
 * whether a self-revert here succeeded.) That is what makes "retry once,
 * then report the same retryable outcome either way" still the right
 * shape for THIS function: unlike the old duplicate_check_failed branch
 * (which existed only because a live-but-unverified batch felt unsafe to
 * treat like an ordinary duplicate), there is no unsafe state left to
 * signal separately here — a failed revert produces a leftover orphan
 * batch needing manual cleanup, same as a successful one produces nothing to
 * clean up; the caller gets the same instruction either way: retry the
 * upload (and, if that now reports a conflict, revert the duplicate).
 *
 * Merge-integration note (item 5, PR #135): revertImportBatch grew a
 * required serviceClient parameter and its own orphan-wine/LWIN-stamp
 * cleanup phase after this function was written. This self-revert IS the
 * kind of debris item 5 targets in spirit — HONESTY-CORRECTED (round-13
 * audit, BLOCK 3): not because "an operator never sees or acts on batch B"
 * (that was false — see point 2 above, B is reachable from Recent
 * imports), but because nothing GUARANTEES a member ever will, and no
 * other code path cleans up whatever B created if they don't — so
 * confirmImportBatch's own serviceClient (threaded from the route, exactly
 * like the /revert route's own createServiceRoleClient()) is passed through
 * here rather than hardcoding null. In practice this is a no-op today: per
 * this function's header above, nothing has applied yet when it runs, so
 * revertImportBatch's applied-rows snapshot is always empty and
 * cleanupOrphanWines/clearBatchLwinStamps both return zero regardless of
 * whether a client is supplied. It's wired anyway on the theory that "the
 * cleanup path receives a real client whenever the caller has one" should
 * hold uniformly across every revertImportBatch call site, not just the
 * ones where it currently matters. */

 * different confirm) in the moments between that query and this call. Every

 * entirely on this one. (Resuming a reverted batch would be DATA-safe
 * regardless — apply only ever selects apply_status='not_applied' rows,
 * and a revert never leaves any row in that state — but it's a confusing
 * dead end for the operator: refused here rather than merely tolerated.)
 *
 * Round-6 audit finding 2: the status re-read above used to run FIRST,

 * live, built from a status value that was stale by the time the caller
 * ever saw it. Reordered so COUNT runs first and the status re-read is the
 * LAST await before this function returns — nothing (no further await, no
 * branch back to the network) sits between reading `current` and either
 * refusing or constructing the result below. A revert can still land in
 * the sub-millisecond gap between that final read returning and this
 * function's own return statement executing — no synchronous function can
 * close a window that isn't itself synchronous — but that residual is
 * about as tight as a single extra round trip can make it, and it is
 * DATA-safe regardless: apply only ever selects apply_status='not_applied'
 * rows, and apply_import_batch_chunk_v2 (0108) already no-ops on a
 * reverted batch, so a client acting on a pointer that reverted a moment
 * after this call returned simply finds nothing to apply, not a duplicate. */

/** Round-10 audit, HONESTY-CORRECTED round-11: this NARROWS the cross-
 * batch apply race — it does NOT close it, and it is not "the real
 * enforcement point" for "at most one applied batch per underlying file."
 * No enforcement point for that invariant currently exists.
 *
 * This is a pure READ, in its own transaction, run immediately before a
 * chunk is allowed to apply — see reconcileLiveBatchesForFile's own
 * comment for why that resume-time function no longer has any destructive
 * authority. Because it is read-only, it has the one property the old
 * revert-based enforcement (BLOCK 1, round-9 audit) lacked: no matter how
 * two concurrent applies interleave around it, it can only ever REFUSE an
 * apply, never destroy a concurrent writer's already-applied rows.
 *
 * But this guard and the apply it gates (applyImportBatchChunk, via the
 * apply route) are separate awaits over separate transactions — there is
 * no lock spanning both. apply_import_batch_chunk (0108) only takes
 * `for update` on ITS OWN batch's import_batches row before inserting
 * inventory and marking rows applied; a sibling batch locks a DIFFERENT
 * row, so nothing serializes two sibling applies against each other. Two
 * clients can therefore both run this guard, both see "no sibling has
 * applied rows yet" (because neither has committed), and both proceed to
 * apply — both persist inventory. This function catches the common
 * SEQUENTIAL case (a resumed batch applying after a sibling already
 * committed applied rows); it does not catch two applies racing
 * simultaneously.
 *
 * Separately, apply_import_batch_chunk is GRANTed EXECUTE to `authenticated`
 * directly (0108, bottom) — any client holding a batch id can call the RPC
 * without ever going through this route, so this guard is not a security
 * boundary either, only a best-effort check the route happens to run.
 *
 * Migration 0128 CLOSES the race properly: apply_import_batch_chunk now takes
 * a transaction-scoped advisory lock keyed by (restaurant, underlying file)
 * and re-checks for an applied sibling under that lock, raising P0004. That
 * is the enforcement point; this function is not.
 *
 * This guard is nonetheless RETAINED, deliberately. Migrations reach
 * production out-of-band rather than from CI, so a build carrying this code
 * can be live before 0128 is applied — deleting the guard on the assumption
 * the barrier is already there would leave production with no protection at
 * all in that window. Once 0128 is confirmed applied in production this
 * function and its call site can be deleted, leaving the route with only the
 * P0004 -> 409 mapping. docs/runbooks/csv-import.md carries the SQL to verify
 * the barrier is live before doing that.
 *
 * A sibling counts as a conflict only once it has an ACTUAL applied row —
 * the same "applied rows are the strongest signal a client is/was really
 * applying this" reasoning reconciliation itself used to use.
 * revert_import_batch (0109) flips every one of a reverted batch's rows
 * OFF apply_status='applied' (to 'reverted') BEFORE flipping the batch
 * itself to 'reverted', so a reverted sibling's rows can never satisfy
 * this query — no separate status filter is needed.
 *
 * contentSha256 not parsing to a well-formed file digest (defensive only —
 * every batch this product creates has one; see confirmImportBatch's own
 * construction) means there is nothing to check against — treated as "no
 * conflict" rather than blocking every apply. */

 * guarantee, unchanged by this relaxation.
 *
 * revert_import_batch only ever deletes the inventory it created — never
 * wines, since a batch row's applied_wine_id may point at a pre-existing
 * wine the apply RPC's upsert matched onto (see wines_dedup_idx), and
 * deleting that would destroy data shared with other batches/scans/manual
 * adds. After the RPC succeeds, best-effort clean up wines/stamps left
 * live by this specific revert's own batch (see cleanupOrphanWines /
 * clearBatchLwinStamps below for exactly what that means and what it
 * does not prove). Cleanup failure must never fail the revert — the
 * revert already succeeded — so both steps are caught and logged, never
 * rethrown.
 *
 * `serviceClient` (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round 3, finding 3): a
 * service-role client, used ONLY by cleanupOrphanWines' reference-
 * existence checks (the bulk sweep and the fresh pre-delete re-check) —
 * never for the snapshot read, the RPC call, or the wine DELETE itself,
 * all three of which stay on the caller's RLS-scoped `supabase` (tenant-
 * scoped, so the DELETE can never itself cross tenants). This is load-
 * bearing, not a preference: stock_adjustments' insert policy checks only
 * the caller's OWN membership + self-attribution (`is_member(restaurant_id)
 * and acting_user_id = auth.uid()`) — it never checks that `wine_id`
 * belongs to that same restaurant (supabase/schema.snapshot.sql, "members
 * insert own stock_adjustments") — and `wine_id` is `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
 * So a tenant-B member can insert a stock_adjustments row naming tenant
 * A's wine_id; A's reference sweep, run on A's own RLS-scoped client,
 * cannot see that row (it's a tenant-B row); Postgres referential-
 * integrity actions bypass row security entirely, so A's wine DELETE
 * would cascade-destroy tenant B's row anyway if the sweep never saw it.
 * A service-role client sees every tenant's rows, closing exactly that
 * gap. `bottle_closeouts` has the identical shape (member insert,
 * `restaurant_id`-only check, nullable `open_bottle_id`, `wine_id` cascade
 * — see WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES). If `serviceClient` is unavailable
 * (misconfigured environment — SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY missing, Sol
 * audit round 4, finding 6), cleanupOrphanWines skips deletion entirely
 * rather than falling back to the RLS client — falling back would silently
 * reintroduce this exact cross-tenant risk — and the result's
 * `orphanCleanupSkipped` flag says so explicitly rather than leaving the
 * caller to infer it from a zero count.
 *
 * TOCTOU WINDOW (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round 5, finding 1 — narrowed
 * further, corrects round 4's analysis, still not closed): round 4
 * believed the fresh, single-wine re-check reduced the forgeable window
 * to "a single round-trip" by running `stock_adjustments`/
 * `bottle_closeouts` LAST inside a sequential findReferencedWineIds call.
 * That belief was wrong twice over: (a) it treated the cross-batch
 * `import_batch_rows` claim — checked FIRST in that same call — as
 * unforgeable, but `import_batch_rows` is itself member-insertable and
 * -updatable with an arbitrary `applied_wine_id` (see
 * WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES' "THESE TWO ARE NOT THE ONLY FORGEABLE TABLE"
 * comment), so the actual forgeable window for THAT table was ~9
 * sequential round-trips, not the "safe to check first" round 4 assumed;
 * (b) `stock_adjustments` and `bottle_closeouts`, checked one after the
 * other with an `await` between them, left a real one-round-trip window
 * for whichever ran first, not zero.
 *
 * The fix: findForgeableReferencesForWine now checks all THREE forgeable
 * tables (the cross-batch `import_batch_rows` claim, `stock_adjustments`,
 * `bottle_closeouts`) CONCURRENTLY via `Promise.all`, as the single final
 * step immediately before the DELETE — no other await in between. The
 * seven remaining WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES tables are trusted from the
 * bulk sweep alone (see cleanupOrphanWines' own header, "WHAT THE FINAL
 * RE-CHECK COVERS, AND WHY THE REST DON'T NEED IT," for why a race there
 * is harmless by construction — RESTRICT-FK or RPC-gated same-tenant-only
 * — rather than merely unlikely). This shrinks the residual window to ONE
 * PARALLEL round-trip for all three tables at once, replacing what was
 * actually ~9 sequential round-trips for the worst of the three under
 * round 4's design. It does NOT close the window: a forged insert landing
 * in that one parallel round-trip is still possible in principle. What
 * makes the residual acceptable rather than merely small differs slightly
 * by table: for `stock_adjustments`/`bottle_closeouts`, the ONLY way a
 * cross-tenant row can exist there at all is by exploiting the
 * pre-existing gap in those two tables' own INSERT policies (neither
 * checks that `wine_id` belongs to the inserting tenant's own
 * `restaurant_id` — see WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES' comment), and `wine_id`
 * is `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so losing that race means that forged row is
 * destroyed — no product code path this app ships ever writes a
 * cross-tenant `wine_id`, so any row that shows up there naming another
 * tenant's wine is necessarily a deliberate, malicious insert exploiting
 * that gap, not innocent concurrent activity, and the forger is the only
 * party who could lose it. For `import_batch_rows`, the same "only a
 * policy-gap exploit could get a row there" reasoning applies, but the
 * consequence of losing the race is strictly milder: `applied_wine_id` is
 * `ON DELETE SET NULL`, not CASCADE, so a forged row that loses the race
 * has its `applied_wine_id` silently nulled, not destroyed. The airtight
 * fixes are both migration-gated and out of reach for this TS-layer-only
 * pass: an ownership `WITH CHECK` on all three tables' write policies
 * (closing the underlying gaps directly), or moving the re-check and the
 * DELETE into one `SECURITY INVOKER` RPC transaction (closing the window
 * itself, not just narrowing it). See "Cross-tenant reference checks run
 * on the service-role client" in docs/runbooks/csv-import.md for the
 * live-tested proof and the tracked status of both fixes.
 *
 * A FOURTH forgeable table, and a CAS on the DELETE itself (Sol audit
 * round 6, finding 1): `availability_events` (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) was
 * missing from findForgeableReferencesForWine entirely, and the danger
 * there isn't a malicious forgery like the three above — it's a
 * genuinely legitimate one. A manager calling set_wine_availability in
 * this exact window is not exploiting any policy gap (that RPC is
 * SECURITY DEFINER, derives restaurant_id from the wine itself, and
 * requires an owner/manager of that same restaurant), yet the wine
 * DELETE would cascade away the audit event it just wrote. This function
 * now checks `availability_events` CONCURRENTLY alongside the other
 * three (four tables total, still ONE parallel page-read — see
 * findForgeableReferencesForWine's own comment). That alone still leaves
 * the same one-round-trip gap this whole section is about, so
 * cleanupOrphanWines' DELETE also gained a compare-and-swap:
 * `.eq("updated_at", <the exact timestamp guard 1 matched>)`. Verified
 * against the schema: `set_wine_availability` UPDATEs `wines` (setting
 * `is_eightysixed`) BEFORE it INSERTs the `availability_events` row
 * (supabase/schema.snapshot.sql, the function body), and
 * `wines_set_updated_at` fires on every UPDATE unconditionally — so that
 * manager's action bumps `updated_at` strictly before its own event
 * exists, and the CAS filter (comparing against the pre-mutation
 * timestamp) matches zero rows, sparing both the wine and the event it
 * just gained. This closes the gap for any writer whose own INSERT is
 * preceded by a `wines` UPDATE — currently just `set_wine_availability` —
 * but does nothing for the other three forgeable tables' own INSERT
 * paths, none of which touch the `wines` row at all
 * (`stock_adjustments`, `bottle_closeouts`, `import_batch_rows` all
 * insert into their own table only): those three still depend entirely
 * on the concurrent Promise.all re-check above, unchanged by the CAS. A
 * zero-row CAS result is treated as a skip (not incremented into
 * `deleted`), never as a failure — see cleanupOrphanWines' own DELETE
 * call for exactly that. See "Cleanup is bounded" in
 * docs/runbooks/csv-import.md for the residual this narrows to.
 *
 * THE GENERAL RULE, NOT A FIFTH SPECIAL CASE (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round
 * 7, finding 1 — BLOCK): the round-6 fix above still framed the re-check
 * as a list of individually-discovered "forgeable tables," which is how
 * it missed three more CASCADE children with the exact same shape as
 * `availability_events`: `open_bottles` (inserted by POST
 * /api/open-bottles, src/app/api/open-bottles/route.ts, on the
 * SERVICE-ROLE client, straight after reading inventory, with no `wines`
 * UPDATE anywhere in that path) and `cellar_health` /
 * `pricing_recommendations` (written the same way by their own
 * service-role recompute jobs, src/lib/cellar-health/recompute.ts and
 * src/lib/pricing-recommendations/recompute.ts). None of the three is an
 * RLS-policy exploit — same as `availability_events`, each is a
 * legitimate, same-tenant, non-malicious writer — but a member being
 * policy-denied from writing them directly does NOT stop these writers,
 * since they run on the service role. The fix is general, not per-table:
 * `findForgeableReferencesForWine` now re-checks EVERY non-RESTRICT
 * direct FK onto `wines(id)`, full stop — see WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES' own
 * comment for the complete classification, re-derived directly against
 * `supabase/schema.snapshot.sql`, and findForgeableReferencesForWine's own
 * comment for the up-to-date per-table reasoning. That's seven tables
 * total now (the three round-5/6 RLS-gap tables, `availability_events`,
 * and these three), still ONE parallel page-read — see
 * findForgeableReferencesForWine's own comment. The CAS guard on the
 * DELETE remains a SECOND, independent layer, not a substitute: it only
 * ever catches a writer whose own INSERT is preceded by a `wines` UPDATE
 * — still just `set_wine_availability` — so `open_bottles`,
 * `cellar_health`, and `pricing_recommendations` depend entirely on this
 * concurrent re-check, exactly as `stock_adjustments`, `bottle_closeouts`,
 * and the cross-batch `import_batch_rows` claim already did. In short:
 * the final parallel read catches every non-RESTRICT child's writer,
 * including service/job paths that never touch the wine row; the DELETE's
 * CAS catches only writers that DO touch the wine row first. See "Every
 * non-RESTRICT child of wines(id) is re-checked in the final parallel
 * read" in docs/runbooks/csv-import.md for the runbook-level statement of
 * this rule.
 *
 * CRITICAL ORDERING (Sol audit 2026-08-27, round 2): the snapshot read
 * below MUST happen BEFORE the revert_import_batch RPC call, not after.
 * revert_import_batch (0109) itself sets `updated_at = now()` on every
 * row it reverts — reading the snapshot afterward would destroy the exact
 * apply-time evidence cleanupOrphanWines/clearBatchLwinStamps depend on.
 * Neither the snapshot read nor the RPC call is ever subject to
 * `cleanupDeadline` below — the deadline governs only the best-effort
 * cleanup phase that runs after both have already completed.
 *
 * The snapshot read is itself wrapped in try/catch (Sol audit 2026-08-27
 * round 3, finding 4): it supports best-effort cleanup ONLY, so a failure
 * reading it must never block the revert RPC itself — the inventory
 * revert is the operation the caller actually asked for. On failure,
 * snapshot is treated as null and BOTH cleanup phases are skipped
 * (reported as zero, not attempted), but the RPC still runs and its
 * result is still returned. */

 * why that combination matters.
 *
 * THESE TWO ARE NOT THE ONLY FORGEABLE TABLE (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round

 * apply_import_batch_chunk and revert_import_batch, never by a direct
 * member insert") was simply false. The cross-batch `import_batch_rows`
 * claim findReferencedWineIds checks is therefore a THIRD forgeable
 * reference, not a safe-to-check-first one — see findReferencedWineIds'
 * own comment for how all three are now handled together. One difference
 * from the other two: `applied_wine_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, not
 * CASCADE — a forged row racing the DELETE has its `applied_wine_id`
 * silently nulled, not destroyed. `stock_adjustments`/`bottle_closeouts`
 * rows, by contrast, are destroyed outright by the CASCADE. Both
 * consequences are named here so neither is understated: nulling a
 * forged row a same-tenant-or-cross-tenant attacker doesn't legitimately
 * own is a shrug; the cascade destruction is the one worth closing at the
 * RLS layer (see below).
 *
 * `stock_adjustments`, `bottle_closeouts`, and `import_batch_rows`'

 * GENERAL rule the final re-check now follows, re-derived directly
 * against `supabase/schema.snapshot.sql` rather than accreted one audit
 * finding/table at a time): every direct FK onto `wines(id)` splits into
 * exactly two groups by its `ON DELETE` action —
 *
 *   RESTRICT (self-protecting; bulk-swept here, never re-checked in
 *   findForgeableReferencesForWine — see its own comment for why a race
 *   there is harmless by construction): `inventory_items.wine_id`,
 *   `wine_list_items.wine_id`, `pour_events.wine_id`.
 *
 *   CASCADE or SET NULL (re-checked in findForgeableReferencesForWine,
 *   immediately before the DELETE, in addition to being bulk-swept here):
 *   `availability_events.wine_id`, `open_bottles.wine_id`,
 *   `cellar_health.wine_id`, `bottle_closeouts.wine_id`,
 *   `stock_adjustments.wine_id`, `pricing_recommendations.wine_id` (all
 *   CASCADE), and `import_batch_rows.applied_wine_id` (SET NULL, checked
 *   separately below as the cross-batch claim since the column isn't
 *   named `wine_id`).
 *
 * A non-RESTRICT table lands in the final re-check for one of two
 * reasons: `stock_adjustments`, `bottle_closeouts`, and the cross-batch
 * `import_batch_rows` claim are forgeable via a gap in their own
 * INSERT/UPDATE RLS policy (see above); `availability_events` (round 6,
 * finding 1), `open_bottles`, `cellar_health`, and
 * `pricing_recommendations` (round 7, finding 1) have no such policy
 * gap — each is written only by a legitimate, same-tenant, non-malicious
 * product code path — but a write from any of them can still land in the
 * TOCTOU window between the bulk sweep and the DELETE, with no RLS-gap

 * own client would call the wine unreferenced and delete it — and
 * Postgres' `ON DELETE CASCADE` bypasses row security entirely when it
 * fires, destroying tenant B's row along with it. A service-role client
 * sees every tenant's rows, so this check (and the DELETE decision it

 *
 * BULK-PHASE ONLY (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round 5, finding 1 — replaces

 * this function is now used only to build the initial orphan-candidate
 * set from the full batch of wines, never as the final, immediately-
 * pre-DELETE re-check for a single wine — that job belongs to
 * findForgeableReferencesForWine below. Because nothing here runs
 * immediately before a DELETE anymore, the request order within this
 * function carries no TOCTOU consequence and is kept in a simple, stable
 * shape: the cross-batch `import_batch_rows` claim first, then every
 * WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES table in the array's own order. (Round 4 had
 * claimed the cross-batch check was safe to run first because
 * "import_batch_rows is never cross-tenant forgeable" — false:
 * `import_batch_rows` is itself member-insertable/-updatable with an
 * arbitrary `applied_wine_id`, same as `stock_adjustments`/
 * `bottle_closeouts` — see WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES' own comment. That
 * error is why the final pre-DELETE re-check was split out into its own,
 * concurrent function instead of continuing to rely on this one's
 * ordering.) `deadline` (Sol audit round 4, finding 2) is threaded into

 * window" was actually two).
 *
 * GENERAL RULE (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round 7, finding 1 — replaces the
 * round-5/6 "forgeable tables" framing, which under-covered by naming
 * tables one audit finding at a time instead of deriving the set from the
 * schema): this function re-checks EVERY non-RESTRICT direct FK onto
 * wines(id) — CASCADE and SET NULL alike — CONCURRENTLY via `Promise.all`,
 * as the last step before the DELETE. That is SEVEN checks total: the
 * cross-batch `import_batch_rows` claim (`applied_wine_id`, ON DELETE SET
 * NULL) and six ON DELETE CASCADE tables — `stock_adjustments`,
 * `bottle_closeouts`, `availability_events` (Sol audit round 6, finding
 * 1), and (Sol audit round 7, finding 1) `open_bottles`, `cellar_health`,
 * `pricing_recommendations`. See WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES' own comment for
 * the full classification, re-derived directly against
 * supabase/schema.snapshot.sql, and for why RESTRICT is the only
 * exemption: the three remaining WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES tables
 * (`inventory_items`, `wine_list_items`, `pour_events`) are `ON DELETE
 * RESTRICT`, so a concurrent insert there simply makes the DELETE that
 * follows fail loudly (caught per-wine by cleanupOrphanWines' own
 * try/catch, counted as a failure, never silently losing data) —
 * re-checking them here would spend a request to prevent an outcome the
 * DELETE itself already prevents safely. Every non-RESTRICT table lands in
 * this group for one of two reasons, both named on its own `fetchAllRows`
 * call above: `stock_adjustments`, `bottle_closeouts`, and the cross-batch
 * `import_batch_rows` claim are forgeable via a gap in their own
 * INSERT/UPDATE RLS policy (see WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES' own comment);
 * `availability_events`, `open_bottles`, `cellar_health`, and
 * `pricing_recommendations` have no such gap — each is written only by a
 * legitimate, same-tenant, non-malicious product code path — but a write
 * from any of them can still land in the TOCTOU window between the bulk
 * sweep and the DELETE, so this re-check is the layer (sometimes the ONLY
 * layer — see below) that catches it.
 *
 * Calling code MUST await this function's result, check it, and issue the
 * DELETE with no other await in between (cleanupOrphanWines does exactly
 * that, and — round 6, finding 1 — also adds a CAS filter to that same
 * DELETE). The CAS filter is a SECOND layer, not a substitute for this
 * one: it only ever catches a writer whose own INSERT is preceded by a
 * `wines` UPDATE — today, only `set_wine_availability` (`availability_
 * events`) — closing the gap for that table specifically. `stock_
 * adjustments`, `bottle_closeouts`, `import_batch_rows`, `open_bottles`,
 * `cellar_health`, and `pricing_recommendations` never touch the `wines`
 * row from their own writers, so for all six of those this concurrent
 * re-check is the ONLY defense; the CAS guard cannot see a write that
 * never touched `wines`. The residual window this whole function leaves,
 * for the tables the CAS guard doesn't also cover, is the single parallel
 * page-read between this function's `Promise.all` resolving and the
 * DELETE request going out, for all seven tables at once, not a
 * sequential ~9-10 round-trip window for whichever table happened to run
 * first under the pre-round-5 design. */

/** Deletes wines that qualify under the guards below — this batch's own
 * apply step created them (guard 1, proof against non-malicious writers
 * only — see its own note) AND nothing else currently references them
 * (guard 2). Not "and only those" in an absolute sense: see guard 1's own
 * scope note for the named, accepted non-malicious residual, and guard
 * 2's for the named cross-tenant residual the re-check narrows but does
 * not close (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round 4, finding 5 — this header
 * previously overclaimed "and ONLY those").
 * Redesigned in the Sol audit 2026-08-27 round-2 pass: round 1's
 * `wines.created_at >= batch.created_at` guard was justified by the FALSE
 * claim that every product write path creating a wine also creates a
 * referencing row in the same operation — real bare-wine paths exist
 * (src/app/api/cellar/route.ts, .../inventory/save-scan/route.ts, .../
 * wines/create-from-lwin/route.ts, the last of which never gets a
 * reference until a later, separate user action). This version checks an
 * exact timestamp equality instead of guessing a window.
 *
 * A wine qualifies for deletion only when ALL of these hold:
 *   1. some row in `snapshotRows` (this batch's applied rows, read BEFORE
 *      the revert RPC ran — see revertImportBatch's header) names it as
 *      applied_wine_id, AND that row's own `updated_at` EXACTLY equals
 *      the wine's `created_at`. apply_import_batch_chunk (0108) inserts a
 *      wine with created_at default now(), then updates that SAME row's
 *      updated_at = now() in the SAME transaction/call — one now() either
 *      way, and no product code path ever writes `created_at` directly.
 *      SCOPE OF THIS GUARD (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round 3, finding 1 —
 *      narrowed from an earlier, overclaimed "provable authorship"):
 *      this equality is proof against every NON-MALICIOUS writer. It is
 *      NOT proof against a malicious one: `wines` RLS grants members
 *      unrestricted UPDATE ("members can update their wines",
 *      supabase/schema.snapshot.sql) with no column-level restriction on
 *      `created_at`, and `import_batch_rows` is member-readable ("members
 *      can read import batch rows") — so a same-tenant member COULD read
 *      a snapshot row's `updated_at` and deliberately rewrite some other,
 *      pre-existing bare wine's `created_at` to match it, forging this
 *      guard into deleting that wine. This is deliberately NOT treated as
 *      a hole to close here: `wines` RLS ALSO grants members unrestricted
 *      DELETE on their own restaurant's wines ("members can delete their
 *      wines"), so a member willing to forge `created_at` already holds
 *      the DELETE right directly — the forgery buys them nothing they
 *      didn't already have. Closing it with new TS-layer mechanism would
 *      add complexity to defend a privilege boundary that doesn't
 *      actually move. The one accepted NON-malicious residual: two
 *      DIFFERENT apply-chunk transactions landing on the exact same
 *      microsecond timestamp — negligible, named here rather than
 *      silently assumed away. This equality is also RESTATED as a CAS on
 *      the DELETE itself (Sol audit round 6, finding 1): the exact
 *      timestamp that proved the match here is re-compared against the
 *      wine's CURRENT `updated_at` in the DELETE's own `.eq()` filter, so
 *      a mutation landing between this read and the DELETE — not just
 *      between the bulk sweep and the DELETE, guard 2's concern below —
 *      makes the DELETE match zero rows instead of proceeding on stale
 *      evidence. See cleanupOrphanWines' own DELETE call for the
 *      mechanics and why it closes the gap only for a writer whose own
 *      INSERT is preceded by a `wines` UPDATE (currently just
 *      `set_wine_availability`);
 *   2. it has zero references across every other wines(id)-referencing
 *      table (WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES) AND zero references from another
 *      batch's import_batch_rows.applied_wine_id, checked once in bulk
 *      (findReferencedWineIds, all ten checks) and then RE-CHECKED,
 *      single-wine, immediately before that wine's own DELETE. THE GENERAL
 *      RULE (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round 5, finding 1, extended round 6,
 *      finding 1, generalized round 7, finding 1 — BLOCK): that final
 *      re-check (findForgeableReferencesForWine) covers EVERY non-RESTRICT
 *      direct FK onto wines(id) — seven tables: import_batch_rows'
 *      cross-batch claim, stock_adjustments, bottle_closeouts,
 *      availability_events, open_bottles, cellar_health, and
 *      pricing_recommendations — run CONCURRENTLY via `Promise.all`, not
 *      the full ten-table sweep again. See WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES' own
 *      comment for the full RESTRICT/CASCADE/SET-NULL classification,
 *      re-derived directly against supabase/schema.snapshot.sql. Only the
 *      three RESTRICT tables are trusted from the bulk pass alone — see
 *      "WHAT THE FINAL RE-CHECK COVERS, AND WHY RESTRICT DOESN'T NEED IT"
 *      below. Both the bulk sweep and the final re-check run on
 *      `serviceClient` (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round 3, finding 3), never
 *      the caller's RLS-scoped client, so a cross-tenant reference in
 *      stock_adjustments or bottle_closeouts is never invisible to the
 *      check that's about to authorize a DELETE (see findReferencedWineIds'
 *      own comment for the full cascade-destruction mechanics this
 *      closes). If `serviceClient` is unavailable, this entire function
 *      no-ops (logs, returns zero, and the caller reports
 *      `orphanCleanupSkipped: true` — Sol round 4, finding 6) rather than
 *      falling back to the RLS-scoped client — falling back would
 *      silently reintroduce that cross-tenant risk.
 *
 *      WHAT THE FINAL RE-CHECK COVERS, AND WHY RESTRICT DOESN'T NEED IT
 *      (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round 5, finding 1, extended round 6, finding
 *      1, generalized round 7, finding 1 — replaces round 4's "closing
 *      most of the window" framing, which itself rested on two errors: it
 *      called the cross-batch `import_batch_rows` claim unforgeable, and
 *      it checked `stock_adjustments`/`bottle_closeouts` sequentially
 *      rather than concurrently, so even its own "single round-trip" claim
 *      was actually two — and replaces round 5/6's "forgeable tables"
 *      framing, which under-covered by naming tables one audit finding at
 *      a time instead of applying a general rule): the re-check and the
 *      DELETE are still two separate steps, so in principle ANY
 *      referencing table could receive a fresh, cascade-linked insert in
 *      the gap between them. The GENERAL RULE this function follows: every
 *      non-RESTRICT WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES table is re-checked here; only
 *      RESTRICT tables are exempt, because for THEM ALONE is the gap
 *      harmless by construction, not merely unlikely — `inventory_items`,
 *      `wine_list_items`, and `pour_events` are `ON DELETE RESTRICT`
 *      rather than CASCADE, so a concurrent insert there fails the DELETE
 *      outright instead of losing data — caught per-wine (see below) and
 *      simply skipped, never silently pretended to have succeeded.
 *
 *      Two different reasons land a table in the re-checked group.
 *      `stock_adjustments` (src/app/api/stock-adjustments/route.ts),
 *      `bottle_closeouts`, and `import_batch_rows`' own cross-batch claim
 *      are genuinely forgeable in the RLS-exploit sense — the first two
 *      cross-tenant (neither requires live inventory to write, and
 *      neither RLS INSERT policy checks that `wine_id` belongs to the
 *      inserting tenant — see WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES' own comment;
 *      bottle_closeouts' own app route, src/app/api/open-bottles/close/
 *      route.ts, actually goes through the tenant-safe, inventory-gated
 *      SECURITY DEFINER `close_open_bottle` RPC (0061), but its table's
 *      OWN "members can insert bottle_closeouts" RLS policy still permits
 *      a direct REST insert bypassing that RPC entirely), the third
 *      same-tenant-or-cross-tenant (any member can insert/update an
 *      import_batch_rows row with an arbitrary `applied_wine_id` — see
 *      WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES' own comment). `availability_events`
 *      (round 6, finding 1), `open_bottles`, `cellar_health`, and
 *      `pricing_recommendations` (round 7, finding 1) land here for the
 *      OTHER reason: none has a member-insertable RLS gap — each is
 *      written only through a SECURITY DEFINER RPC or a service-role
 *      product code path scoped correctly to the wine's own tenant — but
 *      each IS `ON DELETE CASCADE`, and a member being policy-denied from
 *      writing them directly does not stop these writers, since none of
 *      them requires a direct member RLS write at all. `open_bottles` is
 *      inserted by POST /api/open-bottles (src/app/api/open-bottles/
 *      route.ts) on the SERVICE-ROLE client, straight after reading
 *      inventory; `cellar_health` and `pricing_recommendations` are
 *      written the same way by their own service-role recompute jobs
 *      (src/lib/cellar-health/recompute.ts,
 *      src/lib/pricing-recommendations/recompute.ts). `findForgeableReferencesForWine`
 *      checks all seven CONCURRENTLY, immediately before the DELETE that
 *      follows a successful re-check — shrinking this residual from what
 *      round 4 wrongly measured as "~1 round-trip for 2 of 3 tables, ~9
 *      for the third" down to one PARALLEL page-read for all seven. The
 *      DELETE itself also carries the CAS guard from guard 1 above (round
 *      6, finding 1), which independently closes the remaining
 *      one-round-trip gap for `availability_events` specifically — its
 *      writer (`set_wine_availability`) always touches the `wines` row
 *      before inserting its event, so the CAS catches what the concurrent
 *      re-check's own timing might still miss. None of the other six
 *      tables' writers ever touch `wines`, so for all six of them the
 *      concurrent re-check remains the only defense — the final parallel
 *      read is what catches a child-only writer, including a service/job
 *      path, while the DELETE's CAS only ever catches a writer that
 *      touches the wine row itself.
 *
 *      Why the narrowed residual is accepted, for the three RLS-gap
 *      tables, rather than requiring an airtight close here: for
 *      `stock_adjustments`/`bottle_closeouts`, the ONLY way a
 *      cross-tenant row can occupy that final gap at all is by exploiting
 *      the pre-existing gap in those two tables' own INSERT policies — no
 *      product code path this app ships ever writes a `wine_id` outside
 *      its own tenant, so any row that shows up there naming another
 *      tenant's wine is necessarily a deliberate malicious insert
 *      exploiting that policy gap, never innocent concurrent activity;
 *      the forger is the only party who can lose that row, and only by
 *      choosing to exploit a vulnerability that already lets them attach
 *      arbitrary rows to a wine they don't own. For `import_batch_rows`,
 *      the consequence of losing that race is strictly milder: the FK is
 *      `ON DELETE SET NULL`, not CASCADE (see WINE_REFERENCING_TABLES'
 *      own comment), so a forged row racing the DELETE has its
 *      `applied_wine_id` silently nulled, never destroyed — and the only
 *      party who could plant such a row there in the first place is,
 *      again, exploiting `import_batch_rows`' own INSERT/UPDATE policy
 *      gap, which grants them nothing new. Airtight closure needs either
 *      an ownership `WITH CHECK` on all three tables' write policies
 *      (closing the underlying gaps directly, not just this window) or
 *      moving the re-check and the DELETE into one `SECURITY INVOKER` RPC
 *      transaction (closing the window itself) — both are migration-gated
 *      and out of reach for this TS-layer-only pass; see
 *      docs/runbooks/csv-import.md, "Cross-tenant reference checks run on
 *      the service-role client," for the tracked status. For
 *      `availability_events`, the residual after the CAS guard is
 *      narrower still: only a legitimate `set_wine_availability` call
 *      landing in the single remaining gap between
 *      findForgeableReferencesForWine's own `Promise.all` resolving and
 *      the DELETE request going out — after that point the CAS itself
 *      protects it — which is the
 *      same order of residual as the microsecond-timestamp-collision
 *      residual named in guard 1. For `open_bottles`, `cellar_health`, and
 *      `pricing_recommendations`, the residual is the same single parallel
 *      page-read window, with no CAS backstop — accepted because each
 *      writer is a legitimate, same-tenant, non-malicious product code
 *      path, the same order of residual as (a) rather than an
 *      attacker-controlled one;
 *   3. it belongs to the reverting restaurant (explicit filter, matching
 *      this file's belt-and-suspenders pattern — never rely on RLS
 *      alone).
 *
 * Per-wine delete errors are caught individually (Sol round-2 finding 7)
 * so one bad delete never discards the count already earned by wines
 * deleted earlier in the same call; `failures` is for logging only. A
 * `CleanupDeadlineExceededError` (Sol round 4, finding 2) is caught
 * separately from an ordinary per-wine error: it means `deadline` (see
 * CLEANUP_BUDGET_FROM_ENTRY_MS) passed WHILE a request was about to be
 * issued, not that any one wine's own work failed, so it sets `truncated`
 * and stops the whole loop rather than counting a `failures` entry and
 * moving on to the next candidate. `truncated` tells the caller whether
 * that happened, so counts stay accurate for whatever DID run rather than
 * being padded or estimated. */

/** Clears the LWIN linkage this batch's apply left live on a wine, for
 * wines that survive revert (a deleted wine needs no unstamp —
 * cleanupOrphanWines always runs first, see revertImportBatch).
 *
 * CONTRACT (Sol audit 2026-08-27 round 3, finding 2 — rewritten from an
 * "authorship proof" framing that overclaimed what the mechanism below
 * actually establishes): "clear the LWIN linkage this batch's apply left
 * live" means EITHER apply's conflict UPDATE freshly wrote the pair, OR
 * it re-affirmed an identical pre-existing value — both count, and both
 * are intended behavior, not merely tolerated. Concretely: when a row's
 * apply-time dedup-match hits an EXISTING wine that already carries the
 * exact (lwin_id, lwin_match_score) pair this row's own match would also
 * write (a re-imported file, or a member/earlier-batch coincidence),
 * apply_import_batch_chunk_v2's `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` still runs — its
 * CASE expressions leave the SET values unchanged (this row's own score
 * doesn't beat the existing one, so nothing in the pair actually
 * changes), but the UPDATE statement itself still executes and the
 * `wines_set_updated_at` trigger still fires `updated_at = now()` in
 * THIS row's own apply-chunk transaction. That transaction genuinely
 * touched this wine and left exactly this row's own values live —
 * whether or not any byte of `lwin_id`/`lwin_match_score` actually
 * changed — so clearing it on revert is correct under the contract
 * above, not a bug. (This replaces round 1's narrower and FALSE
 * "authorship proof" claim — "a non-null lwin_match_score is only ever
 * written by a batch apply" (round 1 finding 4) — which round 2 already
 * disproved: wines RLS grants members unrestricted UPDATE ("members can
 * update their wines", supabase/schema.snapshot.sql), so any client can
 * pre-write an identical pair. Nothing in the mechanism below changed
 * for round 3 — only the claim about what it proves.)
 *
 * Recovery path for the identical-pre-existing-pair corner: if a stamp
 * gets cleared that a DIFFERENT source (not this batch) actually wanted
 * live, re-running LWIN matching against the wine restores it — the
 * match computation is idempotent and does not depend on import history.
 *
 * A wine's stamp is cleared only when, for ONE of THIS batch's own
 * qualifying snapshot rows (applied_wine_id = wine.id, lwin_id not null,
 * lwin_score >= LWIN_APPLY_MIN_SCORE — only such rows could have been
 * forwarded into wines.lwin_id by apply's 0.6 confidence gate, 0108),
 * BOTH hold:
 *   1. the wine's CURRENT updated_at (read fresh, AFTER the revert RPC —
 *      revert itself never touches wines, so this is still whatever
 *      apply last left) exactly equals that row's OWN updated_at,
 *      captured in the snapshot BEFORE revert ran. apply's wines upsert
 *      and its import_batch_rows UPDATE share one transaction/one now()
 *      (0108), so this equality shows this row's own apply-chunk call
 *      was the LAST write to this wine's row — closing the round-1 hole
 *      for a pre-write or overwrite happening AFTER apply and BEFORE
 *      this revert call (the concrete exploit that finding described):
 *      such a write carries its own, later timestamp, and this equality
 *      correctly fails against it;
 *   2. the wine's CURRENT (lwin_id, lwin_match_score) exactly equals that
 *      row's own (lwin_id, lwin_score). Needed alongside #1, not
 *      redundant with it: EVERY row that dedup-matches an EXISTING wine
 *      bumps that wine's updated_at (apply's ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE always
 *      fires the wines_set_updated_at trigger, whether or not this row's
 *      own LWIN match actually won apply's "prefers higher score"
 *      comparison) — so #1 alone would let this batch clear a stamp it
 *      merely stood NEXT TO (e.g. a higher-scoring match that arrived
 *      from another source and legitimately beat this row's own), not
 *      one whose own values are what's actually live. Requiring the
 *      current value to match this row's own value confirms apply's
 *      CASE genuinely resolved to this row's own pair, not the
 *      pre-existing one it was compared against.
 * Together, both checks still leave one named residual: a third party
 * writing the EXACT (lwin_id, lwin_match_score) pair this row's own LWIN
 * match would independently compute, BEFORE apply ran, on a wine this
 * row also dedup-matches, passes both checks by coincidence. That
 * requires guessing a specific trigram-similarity float to exact
 * precision ahead of time — accepted as negligible, the same order of
 * residual as cleanupOrphanWines' own named microsecond-timestamp-
 * collision residual.
 *
 * The UPDATE itself ALSO re-checks the row's own updated_at server-side
 * alongside the exact (lwin_id, lwin_match_score) pair (verified against
 * the live local stack — see docs/runbooks/csv-import.md), so a
 * genuinely concurrent write between this function's read and its UPDATE
 * makes the match fail and the stamp survives untouched, rather than
 * clobbering whatever that concurrent writer just wrote.
 *
 * This REPLACES round-1's "highest score wins" stamps map and its
 * associated equal-score tie nondeterminism (round-1 finding 6, round-2
 * finding 5) outright: instead of picking one candidate stamp per wine
 * ahead of time, every qualifying row for a wine is tried, and only the
 * row whose own values are actually still live (checks 1+2) ever
 * matches — there is nothing left to break ties over; whichever row the
 * database itself deterministically applied last (by row_number order,
 * inside apply_import_batch_chunk's own loop) is the one that passes.
 * It also REPLACES round-1's "another live batch justifies this stamp"
 * lookup (round-1 finding 4's unpaged query, round-2 finding 4's second
 * half): if another batch's apply genuinely won the wine after this one,
 * ITS transaction's timestamp is what's live on wines.updated_at, so
 * check 1 above already fails for this batch's row — the separate
 * justification lookup added nothing the timestamp check doesn't already
 * give for free, so it is dropped along with the unpaged status query it
 * required.
 *
 * Per-wine errors are caught individually so one failing UPDATE never
 * discards counts already earned earlier in the same call (Sol round-2
 * finding 7), same contract as cleanupOrphanWines. `deadline` / `truncated`
 * (Sol round-3 finding 5, arithmetic corrected round 4 — see
 * CLEANUP_BUDGET_FROM_ENTRY_MS): same shared soft-deadline contract as
 * cleanupOrphanWines, checked before the candidate wine lookup's own
 * request(s) and before every per-wine UPDATE, not just once — see that
 * function's header. This function does NOT need a service-role client
 * (unlike cleanupOrphanWines): it only ever reads/writes wines already
 * scoped to `restaurantId`, never checks another tenant's rows in another
 * table. */
