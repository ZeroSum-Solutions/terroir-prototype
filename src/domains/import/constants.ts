 *
 * Round-10 fix — RAISED from 60 to 120: 60 was inherited from the routes'
 * (now-confirmed-inert) `maxDuration = 60` metadata, not derived from any
 * real constraint — and once LWIN_MATCH_MAX_QUERIES' own arithmetic was
 * corrected (round-29 audit) to use the concurrency-inflated per-call time,
 * 60s could no longer authorize even a plain MAX_ROWS (5,000) file where
 * every row carries a producer (1 query/row = 5,000 queries), the single
 * most common large-import shape. That is a capability regression, not a
 * safety win, and the 60s number had no platform basis to defend it.
 *
 * Chosen instead by solving forward from two real constraints: (1) the
 * documented capability the product actually offers — MAX_ROWS (5,000)
 * rows — should pass with REAL margin, not sit right at the boundary, so
 * the target is a query capacity of at least 2 x MAX_ROWS (10,000) —
 * enough for the pure producer-bearing case (5,000 queries, 2x headroom)
 * AND a meaningfully mixed file (e.g. up to 2,500 producer-less rows at
 * the 3x variant fan-out, still exactly 10,000); (2) the ceiling must stay
 * comfortably inside Railway's real, documented constraint — its HTTP
 * proxy's ~5-minute (300s) no-data timeout, not the inert `maxDuration`.
 * Solving `floor(ceiling / LWIN_MATCH_PER_CALL_SECONDS_AT_CONCURRENCY) *
 * LWIN_MATCH_CONCURRENCY * LWIN_MATCH_BATCH_SIZE >= 10,000` for `ceiling`
 * needs `floor(ceiling / 4.796) >= 25`, i.e. `ceiling >= 25 * 4.796 ≈
 * 119.9s`. 120s (2 minutes) is the clean round number just above that —
 * only 40% of Railway's 300s timeout, leaving 60% (180s) of margin for
 * response marshaling, network overhead, and the rest of the request
 * lifecycle beyond the matching phase itself. The operator now sees a
 * live wait estimate before the wait begins (estimateChunkedPhaseWaitSeconds,

 * generate is `validRows + 2 * producerLessRows`, never just the

 * `floor(LWIN_MATCH_UX_CEILING_SECONDS / LWIN_MATCH_PER_CALL_SECONDS)` =
 * `floor(60 / 4.4)` = 13 waves -> `13 * 4 * 100` = 5,200 queries — using the
 * single-call 4.4s figure directly, while LWIN_MATCH_CONCURRENCY's own
 * comment (above) records a ~9% per-call latency INCREASE from contention
 * at that same concurrency. 13 waves at the actually-applicable per-call
 * time (4.4 * 1.09 ≈ 4.796s) is 13 * 4.796 ≈ 62.3s — over
 * LWIN_MATCH_UX_CEILING_SECONDS (60), contradicting the very ceiling this
 * cap exists to enforce. Recomputed against
 * LWIN_MATCH_PER_CALL_SECONDS_AT_CONCURRENCY — the single source of truth
 * for both this budget and LWIN_MATCH_CONCURRENCY's own contention note —
 * instead: `floor(60 / 4.796)` = 12 waves -> `12 * 4 * 100` = 4,800 queries
 * max. 12 waves at ≈4.796s/wave ≈ 57.6s, inside the then-60s budget with
 * margin; the excluded 13th wave would be ≈62.3s, over it — exactly the
 * boundary `floor` exists to enforce.
 *
 * Round-10 fix — RECONCILED against the product's documented capability:
 * the 4,800 figure above is arithmetically correct for a 60s ceiling, but
 * it exposed a genuine contradiction — a plain MAX_ROWS (5,000) file where
 * every row carries a producer generates exactly 5,000 queries, which
 * EXCEEDS 4,800. The ordinary, most common large import was rejected
 * before any matching ran. The 60s ceiling was never a platform limit (it
 * was inherited from the routes' inert `maxDuration` metadata — see
 * LWIN_MATCH_UX_CEILING_SECONDS' own comment) and had no basis to
 * override the product's own stated row limit, so the ceiling moved
 * instead of MAX_ROWS: with LWIN_MATCH_UX_CEILING_SECONDS now 120,
 * `floor(120 / 4.796)` = 25 waves -> `25 * 4 * 100` = **10,000 queries
 * max**. 25 waves at ≈4.796s/wave ≈ 119.9s, inside the 120s budget; the
 * excluded 26th wave would be ≈124.7s, correctly over it. 10,000 gives a
 * plain MAX_ROWS all-producer-bearing file (5,000 queries) 2x headroom,
 * and still correctly rejects the producer-less worst case at MAX_ROWS
 * (5,000 rows x up to 3 queries each = 15,000 > 10,000) — the budget still
 * does its job of preventing a genuinely unbounded wait, it just no
 * longer rejects the product's own documented capability to do so.
 *
 * enforceLwinMatchQueryBudget (preview-service.ts) checks the file/chunk's
 * ACTUAL generated query count (buildLwinQueryVariants already run, before
 * matchLwinBulk's first RPC call) against this number — the real count, not
 * a worst-case estimate, so a file that happens to have shorter
 * producer-less names (fewer than the worst-case 3 variants each) is never
 * rejected more conservatively than its real query cost warrants. Both
 * buildImportPreview call sites (the preview route, and confirm's own
 * re-derivation — see confirmImportBatch's header) share this one function
 * and one cap.
 *
 * WARN 5 (round-29 audit) — CORRECTED: the claim that used to sit here,
 * "a file can never pass preview and then fail confirm (or vice versa) on
 * this budget," is FALSE whenever row overrides are involved. The preview
 * route calls buildImportPreview with no rowOverrides at all (there is
 * nothing to override yet — this IS the first look at the file); confirm
 * calls it with the operator's overrides applied (confirmImportBatch's own
 * header). A row this function counts as "error" (missing/invalid
 * required field) is filtered out of lwinQueries entirely — it contributes
 * ZERO queries at preview. If an override fixes exactly the field that was
 * failing, the SAME row counts as valid at confirm and contributes up to 3
 * queries (producer-less) or 1 (producer-bearing) — a query count that did
 * not exist when preview computed its own total against this same cap. A
 * file sitting just under the cap at preview, with enough producer-less
 * error rows subsequently fixed, can therefore legitimately EXCEED it only
 * at confirm — preview and confirm share one cap, but not one input, so
 * they are not guaranteed to share one verdict. See buildImportPreview's
