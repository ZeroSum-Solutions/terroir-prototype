/**
 * The read stage of an invoice scan: OCR when Azure answers, the photo
 * itself when it cannot.
 *
 * The pipeline used to be OCR-or-nothing. With Azure unconfigured (local,
 * staging) or its resource gone (production since #116 — the endpoint no
 * longer resolves) every invoice scan died at the first stage, and the
 * vision models that already read bottle labels were never asked. This
 * stage tries Azure first (multi-page fan-out with one compatibility boundary
 * per page, then a merge), and on `not_configured` or `upstream_error` hands the pages to
 * `extractFromImages` instead — visibly: Sentry gets a warning each time,
 * and the persisted `ocr_text` says `source: "vision"` with no raw text.
 *
 * Not a fallback case: `empty_text`. Azure ran and found nothing to read;
 * a second opinion from a vision model on a blank photo is a guess.
 *
 * Kill switch: `INVOICE_VISION_FALLBACK=off` restores OCR-or-nothing.
