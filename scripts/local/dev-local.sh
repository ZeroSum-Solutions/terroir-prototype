#
# Run the dev server against the LOCAL Supabase stack.
#
# `pnpm dev` on its own does not do this. Next loads the dotenv file, and per
# AGENTS.md non-negotiable #1 that file holds PRODUCTION credentials — a
# hosted project URL and a production service-role key. So the plain command
# starts a development server, with development's relaxed guards, holding a
# key that bypasses RLS on the live tenant database. /api/dev-login is the
# sharp edge: it is disabled only when NODE_ENV === "production", which is
# false here, so it will mint a magic link against production instead.
#
# Nothing about that is visible in the terminal. The server prints a
# "Environments" line and a localhost URL either way, so the only signal that
# a session is hitting production is the data that comes back.
#
# This script pins the local stack in the PROCESS environment, which Next
# resolves ahead of any dotenv file, and reads the keys from `supabase status`
# rather than hardcoding them, so a `supabase stop && start` that re-mints
# them cannot silently leave this pointing at a dead stack.
#
# Usage:  scripts/local/dev-local.sh [-p 3000] [...next dev args]
