/**
 * Drive a session into the production-SHAPED local tenant, and back out.
 *
 * `Osteria Scala` is the best case on every axis a wine renders
 * on — 250 wines, 250 photographs, no blank producers, every row spine-linked.
 * Production is the worst case on all four. `LOCAL PRODSHAPE - Trattoria
 * Bianca` (scripts/local/prodshape.sh) holds production's ratios instead, so a
 * QA pass can see what production actually looks like through the real UI.
 *
 * ── HOW THE SWITCH WORKS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A HAND-FORGED COOKIE ───────────
 *
 * `src/lib/api/resolve-active-membership.ts` resolves the active restaurant
 * from a signed `active_restaurant_id` cookie, falling back to the most
 * recently created membership. The app already owns both halves of that:
 * `PUT /api/restaurant/{id}` verifies membership and then writes the signed,
 * HttpOnly cookie itself (`setActiveRestaurant`). Signing one here would mean
 * a second copy of the HMAC — and a fixture that keeps working after the app's
 * own signing changes is a fixture that has stopped testing the app.
 *
 * `page.request` shares the browser context's cookie jar, so the cookie the
 * route sets is the cookie the next `page.goto` sends.
 *
 * ── THE DEFAULT IS UNCHANGED ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The fixture's memberships are written with a deliberately OLD `created_at`
 * (2026-01-05), so a session that has not called `enterProdShape` still lands
 * in the demo tenant — which every other spec in this directory assumes, a
 * dozen of them via their own `created_at DESC limit 1` lookup. Nothing here
 * changes that; a spec that enters the fixture should leave it again in an
 * `afterAll` if it shares a context.
