/**
 * The guard on the production-shaped fixture (scripts/local/prodshape.sh).
 *
 * Two claims, and the first one is the load-bearing half: adding a second
 * membership to the dev-login owner is exactly the change that would silently
 * break every other spec in this directory, because
 * `src/lib/api/resolve-active-membership.ts` falls back to the MOST RECENTLY
 * CREATED membership and a dozen specs re-implement that lookup themselves.
 * The fixture's memberships are therefore written with a deliberately old
 * `created_at`; this asserts the consequence rather than trusting it.
 *
 * The second claims the switch works through the app's own route, not a
 * hand-forged cookie. See e2e/prodshape.ts.
